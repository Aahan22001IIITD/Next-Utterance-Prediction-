Do you know what that's about?\", \"Alright, so you feel like, everything's kind of going your way. Hmm. And you're really excited about the new business idea. I know that your brother was a little concerned with how much you've been spending on the business idea. And he mentioned some things about different relationships you've had that are new.\", \"He's worried that you don't want to think this was the new relationship you don't know the guy too well\", \"So your brother just doesn't. In your mind, he just doesn't get it.\", 'Have you noticed through all this, any change in sleep patterns?', \"Notice you do feel rested. You haven't been sleeping as much.\", \"And you clearly seem like you're in a good mood No, no sadness right now at that,\", 'should be doing pretty well that way. Have you ever been down or depressed?', 'Do you ever feel this way before? kind of in a really good,', 'No. Nothing like this.', 'What do you think about all this one?', \"it's kind of realizing that it's kind of changed my life\", 'All right, and you mentioned before that you got some trouble at work', 'right? How bad that turned out', \"shouldn't have to worry about that.\", \"Any medical conditions, you know, have a drug and alcohol you're saving is anything like that?\", \"Are you seeing or hearing anything that other people can't see or hear?\", \"no like that? Sure. So I know that you're feeling pretty well. But I would like you to see a counselor, maybe help you as you contemplate these different things we've been talking about. If you'd be if you'd be okay with talking to a counselor,\", \"You'd be okay with that. I'll get that set up. We'll just take a moment. And I want to thank you for answering my questions. This has been helpful.\", \"I'm doing well. Thanks for asking.\", \"What's been going on this last week?\", 'So how much should you drink in total?', 'But How long had it been since you had a drink? before that?', \"three weeks or so. She did really well. And then you had you had one drink. And that just made you feel like you weren't successful.\", 'And you feel that kind of led to drinking some more. So you had a rough time with things?', 'what now', 'is that where you were when that first strike? was out with friends?', \"So there's a few things going on.\", \"We've talked in the past, right about separating the behavior from the person. Right? So, behavior is what we do, not who we are. You remember those discussions? And correct me if I'm wrong with sounds like I'm using different words than you use. But it sounds like when you had that first drink, you're kind of ashamed that you had a drink and you had it during the time when you would have been working.\", \"That's pretty accurate. All right. So taking yourself kind of back to that moment. All right, we we had that first. That first drink like you finished that first drank\", 'What was your What was your thought at that at that moment?', 'Okay, so shameful is kind of like the feeling. But the thought is I did really, really well. Right?', \"So that's what your thinking was. I did really, really well.\", 'And what? was that the end of the thought, or was that was there more before you had that next trick?', \"sort of sequence would have been you had to drink. You felt shameful. At the same time you're thinking that you were doing really well. And then just really, as you said before, you just felt like a loser. And then you decided, might as well just have the second drink. So another thought might be that, like, I might just have a second drink.\", 'yeah. So you can see others some thoughts and some feelings at work. right as you finish that first drink was a fairly quick, but those thoughts feelings fairly. occur fairly quickly after the drink.', 'so right away, you regret it and that regret As you thought about it,', \"don't might as well just just continue drinking now, because you kind of blew it.\", 'Okay.', \"And that's a common cycle to fall into. And you had three weeks, we hadn't had a drink prior to that. So let's, let's look at this. Let's try to separate the behavior from the self a little bit. If you had if you had a friend who was in the same predicament, right, you had a history of using alcohol and then at three weeks, without any alcohol use, and then their behavior was to have a drink. What would you think of them?\", 'I had a rough day one drink, and what would you think of their behavior? How would you categorize that behavior?', 'So not ideal,', 'depending on their point of view, maybe a little irresponsible.', \"irresponsible, but you wouldn't necessarily characterize them as a bad person.\", 'But their behavior was a bit of responsible.', 'You know, in terms of like the recovery plan, which would be to not drink.', 'But when you apply that same example examination to your own situation, how do you characterize yourself after you had that first drink?', \"So you see how you're you're being a little bit quite a bit rougher on yourself. Like your your evaluation of yourself is, is fairly harsh. You mentioned loser earlier and ashamed.\", \"Whereas you wouldn't necessarily evaluate someone else that way.\", 'How would you evaluate your behavior? How would you How would you judge your behavior taking that first drink?', 'So, so bad, irresponsible, shameful.', 'Is there a way to separate that behavior in terms of in terms of your thinking, the way you evaluate it from yourself, like are you into behavior?', 'together a meshed or can you be separated?', \"in that moment. It's very congruent for you.\", \"the shame matches the behavior to behavior matches shame. Like it's there one at that moment. Mm hmm. But really, logically, rationally, you're you, Ryan, your identity and values and your behavior, something you do.\", \"But in the moment, it's hard for you to see that.\", 'Mm hmm. Looking back on it now is are you able to see the distinction between what people do and what they are?', 'no, certainly not. And you were, you were clean for three weeks, and you had one drink. So really, your behavior was a slip.', \"Right It was and irresponsible in relationship to your goals, I suppose. But still a slip. And you could have stopped. But that shame got ahold of you. Right. I thought, well, now I've done it. I blew it. Yeah. So with that mentality, you kind of set yourself up for drinking more. So, I think this is important because we've seen this cycle like where you have weeks of sobriety, and then we'll drink a bit and then have weeks as writing. And I'm wondering if part of the difficulty you're facing is you're not coping with the slips as just slips\", \"You're allowing them to be gateways into a lot more drinking than the slip. Does that make sense? That That's pretty accurate.\", \"And you see how the shameful feelings kind of just interfere with the behavior that you really want that's really consistent with their goals, which would be to not continue drinking.\", \"Another piece of this too is the association associating with friends who drink, you're putting yourself in a treacherous situation. Again, that's a behavior.\", \"Right? That doesn't make you one way or the other. It's a behavior. How would you judge that behavior going out with friends?\", \"risky, okay. It's a risky behavior. And what does it make you Who are you? Because you do that behavior. Like how do you feel about yourself? When you take that risky, behavior,\", 'okay', \"So you have guilt when you go out with your friends. And then you have shame if you drink. And both, in this case, both emotions that kind of point you in the direction of more drinking. So part of this behavioral strategy here is to avoid the circumstances like to recognize that's a risky behavior, which you have. And the other part would be to deal more effectively if you do slip away, right. Does that does that separation of what we do and who we are? makes sense to rationally?\", 'feels a little unnatural, though.', \"So maybe, as you're confronting\", \"similar situations in the course of the next week, You could be aware of behaviors that might put you at risk, and try to try to separate your identity from that behavior. So, so just judge the behavior. Okay. Right. And don't don't pass any judgment on yourself.\", 'So that makes sense.', 'It might help you to.', \"Since it's a little tough to because right now, the feeling and the judgment, retro twined. Right. It might help to write down when these things happen, and kind of write down like, like one row for this is how I judge this behavior. But I'm thinking about doing and this is how I judge myself. So if you see a lot of self judgment, that might be a clue that you're falling into a cycle a little bit,\", \"where you're making decisions based on that emotion instead of a rational judgment and behavior.\", 'that helped a little bit.', \"So that'll be our plan going forward.\", \"Until next week is note document your judgment about your behavior, any judgment you may have about yourself. Right, and there's some insight that can be gained there. Right. Kind of distinguish the two and making those and try to use that evidence before making a decision to might put you in a risky spot.\", 'Sound like plan?', \"Okay, good. I'll see you next week. And we'll see how you did with those goals.\", 'Was there anything about the CBT, in particular, that you found was helpful for you?', 'whether any drawbacks to going for CBT', 'Sounds like it was a good experience for us. If you go Any advice that you would want to offer anyone who is thinking now about going for CBT?', \"Okay. I understand you've had some recent difficulties that have brought you in here today.\", 'why do you think she did that?', 'So you believe you have a physical illness?', 'And your physician has run a series of tests.', \"something. There's something there. So what was her other than coming to Sydney? What was her suggestion for treatment? So she ran tests? She didn't find anything.\", \"So she's saying there's no physical illness?\", \"I'm not sure.\", 'how long have you been If that you had a physical illness,', 'So about a year ago, you went to her. She started running tests. And there was no findings of a disorder.', 'Was it just one disorder that you thought you had? Or have there been several,', 'your physicians, physicians run tests for all these disorders who thought you had? We think', \"So I see you're worried.\", 'So you saw the physician for the first time regarding this a year ago. Did you have anxiety or worry before that?', 'But you were you were worried about the illness. Nothing else though. Do you have any physical symptoms?', 'do you find yourself checking often? To see if you have physical symptoms?', 'are you active on the internet forums where they discuss illnesses So,', 'So you read you read the form Satya post.', 'What would you like us to hear that the agency', \"yeah, you're worried you have a physical, a physical health disorder. Are you worried? Do you have a mental health disorder?\", \"you're worried about that.\", 'So concern that the worry could be a symptom of a physical illness.', 'So again, what would your what would your goal be here? What do you want? What do you want to change? through counseling?', 'You want to worry? worry less?', \"So you have you've had Maury for at least a year, specifically about being physically ill. There's been no findings of physical illness, but you're still worried about him. And you might be a little worried that you're, you have a mental health disorder.\", 'And you want to be able to stop worrying about the physical health disorder? All right. Are you worried right now that you have physical health disorder?', 'What disorder Do you think you might have now', \"And you've been tested for this by your physician.\", \"are you ever reassured when you get negative test results back when I said there's there's nothing going on.\", 'You want to rerun tests?', \"All right. So you're open to counseling here.\", 'Would you be okay. sigh release so that I could talk to your physician?', \"So I'll get you scheduled now schedule you either way, whether you want sign release or not. But that's just something I think might be helpful for me to better understand what's going on. But I'll get you in to see a counselor. Oh, just take a couple days. We'll get that worked out now. Okay, great. Thank you.\", \"okay. What's been going on?\", 'lot of anger. Yeah. Can you give me some examples?', 'So quite a bit of anger.', \"Right. So from your perspective, it doesn't seem to make sense why he got so angry.\", 'did anything change around the time that I started?', \"Alright, so you're getting upset you have some anger\", \"any other time that you're feeling angry\", \"Alright, so that experience for you. You feel like you're releasing more energy than maybe the other people in the game can wait\", 'Alright, so the', \"in recent memory, your anger has increased, but it's still not really clear what's going on. that's causing the anger.\", 'You feel busy, like in your daily life, like a lot of responsibilities?', \"and what kind of things you're doing.\", 'see a lot of responsibilities in the home.', 'What type things are you doing?', \"You're doing everything and has always been this way.\", \"Okay. Where you're really just doing everything in the home.\", 'I want to ask you', \"Can I ask you or mention a few words? Right? I would like you to, if you're okay with this exercise, tell me the first thing that comes to mind like and you can buy say a word, you can offer several responses. But try not to invest a lot of thought into the response more just what occurs to you. Oh, but does that make sense?\", 'All right. So the first word is', 'repetition.', 'All right. Let me give you another word, relationship.', 'Let me offer you another word', 'work.', 'Good, alright. How about another word here? Power', 'So do you see any', 'themes and in the words that you provided back', 'controlled and structured?', \"What's the source of that controlling structure? Is there a source of it?\", \"Somebody told me you're thinking,\", \"So as you're telling me this and you're explaining kind of that relationship with your fiance What are you feeling?\", \"is a similar to the anger that you've been experiencing recently. Like at the dry cleaner places.\", \"Serious thinking that maybe that relationship or something part of that relationship is what's really causing the anger.\", \"So is this is your talk about this do you feel like this is new information you're kind of realizing something that you didn't realize before\", 'So you feel this, this kind of big moment in terms of awareness.', \"Okay, so maybe through this session, you develop more insight about what's contributing to the anger.\", \"But But this source of anchor, this relationship, you recognize this is maybe more causal or more contributing? Yeah. Where's the other objects of your ad? If you weren't really sure,\", \"All right, chess move. I feel like we've made some progress here. And I'd like you to between now and next session, if you're comfortable with it, kind of reflect on what themes have maybe come to the surface, what informations may have been revealed to you a little bit. And we can pick up there and explore this further with the anger issue. So that's like a good plan.\", \"Well, I appreciate you coming in today, and I'll see you in week. Okay. Thank you.\", \"I'm doing all right. How things been since last week?\", \"okay, sounds like a couple things may be going on. In child has been sick so youre taken off days. So there's a little worried about your relationship with your employer. At the same time, you want to make sure you're taking good care of your child having trouble reconciling those two.\", 'All right. What was the last time it happened, can you described what happened?', 'Hmm', \"Alright, so let me see. Let's go through each day. Right. So the first day when we discovered that she was sick, right well, we Thinking that when you had to call out of work\", \"Okay, so you're thinking was this isn't ideal, but I can I can live with it.\", 'Just one, just one day?', \"How about one on one, day two, when you realize that you're gonna have to take a second day,\", 'Okay. So a little more stressful version of what happened on day one. And then how about when you discovered that you had to take a third day off?', 'So guilty and a bad mom. And that was mostly on third. That was the worst of it.', 'Now this go up against the weekend was the third day Friday. All right, so, so then you kind of knew that by Monday, things would be better. So tell me what happened when you returned to work on Monday?', 'just do what I can to not miss more. So they said that?', 'so, they were understanding?', 'Did you anticipate worst reaction than you experienced?', 'As a sort of like it took them by surprise?', 'And they were investing a lot of energy in thinking about that?', 'And when was the second how long?', 'So how has this week been back at work?', 'other than that first and other ?', \"And there's been no more absences?\", 'Okay, earlier you mentioned being a good mom How a good mom look lik?', \"And you're a little worried through this was last experience you're talking about that you didn't rise level of good mom?\", \"Okay, so so good, mom's more about More than just rather, your behavior, right, what you're doing is about what you're also thinking. So you took care of your child.\", \"But your mind, your thoughts are somewhere else some of the time. And that's where you feel like you've, you've wandered out of the good mom area. Okay, I've been on the other side, how about a good employee? Did you mention that? You want to be a good employee?\", \"What's what's that look like?\", \"And that's where you feel like with the sort of the last workdays you missed. You missed three. Okay, how about last year? How many days have you missed?\", \"So that's understandable but excluding that?\", 'Okay, total nine?', \"And you're allowed?\", 'I can see that will cause worry what happens if you go over the 10', 'Is anybody that you work with that you could ask that question to HR department?', \"I'm just thinking because you're just one day away, from being at that number might be prudent just to talk with them and see. See, you know what to expect, right? So this whole thing though, the missing days caused you anxiety, frustration.\", 'about any type of feeling down at all?', \"Okay, so that so as far as your child is concerned in your relationship with your child, yes, some anxiety relationship at work, some anxiety, but the sadness mostly surrounds how you feel you're treating your job. Of all the emotions of frustration, anxiety, what I'll refer to as depression I should say sadness. What's bothering you the most? What? emotional response is probably the most?\", 'How would you rate yourself right now as a mother if say 10 was the best mother you could imagine? Right? And one was the absolute worst?', \"Okay. That's pretty good, right?\", \"What would be the cutoff to where? What's the cutoff score? And that will scale I just gave it for good mother and not good mother.\", 'so five is good enough.', 'Okay. Okay', 'So if you look at somebody else, another person in similar situation of five would be acceptable. Right?', 'But how about for you specifically?', \"that's not gonna cut it?\", \"Well, we've cut it.\", \"and you're an eight\", 'sure?', \"not sure. Okay. So you're close to the border. Like you're close to the border on you're your value system of being not a good mother.\", 'Okay. Now, what do you want to be?', 'eight or higher where you are in s you said?', 'okay. So you want to be the parent sounds like', 'I mean, I think people are driven to, to do their best. But is it crucial to be perfectly crucial to be a 10?', \"Remember before in other sessions for the situations you've brought in here, we've talked about dysfunctional thinking, irrational thinking. How does reflect on that, like the usefulness of of these thoughts? The, you know, the other mothers can be a five and B. And that's, that's good, right? You need to be an eight or hire a nine or 10 , does it seem useful, like a useful way of thinking?\", 'Okay, So it does have a useful side does have an unusual side less than useful?', \"Yeah. So I guess one things I'm getting at here is has to worry has the anxiety or it paid off for you?\", \"Why not? So you're suffering with it?\", \"it might make you a little more vigilant but mostly most, it's just causing suffering.\", \"So at the heart of it, you're not a bad mom. Right? You're in good mom category. You're a good employee. Right. But your, your way of dying yourself, Your perception is that you're not doing a great job at either one.\", \"And that's the thinking I'm getting that it's not, you know, it's not necessarily irrational. I'm thinking it's just less than useful. It's dysfunctional.\", \"Yeah, we're talking about that third day, right. The the third day of work you had to you had to call off. And do you remember any specific thoughts that are going through your mind on that? What was that a morning when you figured it out? Like a Friday morning?\", 'so your thought was, am I gonna get fired?', 'And then what was the feeling that that came right after that?', 'maybe some anxiety?', 'Were you able to do anything to address that panic or your anxiety at that time? Like, did you tell yourself anything? Or did you take some action?', 'and how did you feel after you  consciously had that thought?', 'the whole time. Probably all the way till Monday, right when you returned to work?', \"So we've talked before about self talk, you might remember me saying the phrase adaptive response, right? So it's the kind of pre packaged response we have two thoughts that we've identified is not so useful.\", 'So degree, those thoughts like, Am I going to get fired and all that? Not very useful in that moment?', 'understandable. Right, but not useful.', \"So what's you had sort of some self talk that you apply on your own, what some other self talk with some other another thought that you could think or something you can say yourself that could counter an automatic thought like that. Like, specifically, I'm gonna lose my job.\", \"So, so there the self talk there is there's no clear indication that's gonna happen,\", 'So why borrow the worry? Right? How about other habit adaptive behaviors? We talked about the importance of support systems before other sessions. Is there anybody else that could watch your child if you were really running up against that?', 'Did you explore those options for this last time?', 'So none of those individuals were available?', 'Is there any other options you have for care? Was that it?', \"that seems reasonable. Okay, so there are some things you've already done. Right. And I think at this point, since to address I know this is the lesser of your worries, which is your employer, you're more worried about being a good mom, but to go look at the employer side first. Second, you can talk to HR, you can try to understand what the consequences are for going over explained that doesn't appear to be your fault.\", \"Okay. And I don't know what you can do in terms of support, maybe try to get a better awareness of the schedules when they're available and or convey the nature of your problem to them. Customer Support\", 'So that was one issue. Now if you highlight more prominently though, the good mother want to touch on that as well. You did everything you had to do to care for your child?', 'Are you sure?', 'okay hundred percent ?', \"Okay. And we'll get to that but your behavior behavior. Yeah, you did everything a good mom would do.\", \"Okay. So is it okay? If you're doing everything you need to do to think thoughts that don't seem congruent with that, you know, the distract you away from that?\", \"It's not ideal. So you'd really rather be have the ability to be really focused on what's going on your child to the exclusion of what's going on other circumstances?\", \"So by addressing the employer issue, that might give you a little relief one good mom ish. All right. So here's another opportunity to talk about dysfunctional thoughts. I think that is reflect on whether you're a good mom or not, you're really basing it on this idea that if I'm thinking about something other than my child, I'm in the wrong place in terms of being a good mom. Are you only being distracted?\", 'so that pushes you on a one to 10 scale?', 'the more thoughts you have like that you think of it as like pushing you down toward five.', \"Okay. So when you have those thoughts what's an adaptive response or you know, self talk, what can you tell yourself in those moments?\", \"Who doesn't know you're distracted or worried?\", 'Just you?', \"So the self talk that would be I'm doing what I have to do to be a good mom. And that's what my child says. Right\", \"But I have these understandable thoughts that come in where I worry about other things and more or less justice what it is, right? I mean, you're permitted to worry about things life isn't going to be worryfree\", 'But we can, we can work to not suffer more than we have to', 'That kind of makes sense?', \"Yeah, it's a little less than useful it's not, you know, I want this important distinction. It's not good or bad right. And those words have a function right in our in our lives, but they're a little dangerous when applied in terms of mental health when they're applied to things like you know, good mom, bad mom.\", \"But doesn't leave a lot of gray area to talk about. improvement. Right? Also, it seems like what you're describing your, your way into the good mom category anyway. Sure. 8 or 10 I think most people would be happy with an eight out of 10.\", \"So it's not like you've drifted down toward five before somewhere. Okay. So there's a couple different Yeah, I know we talked about two different subjects, right, but they're related the work situation and situation care for a child. But those are some self talk strategies. So I'd like you to do when you go home today, and I would I would ask you to do it today if you can. Okay, I think it's important in the states in terms of time, near when we're having this conversation. If you could try to document some of those automatic thoughts. Remember, I gave you a worksheet before and then work on some of your own calm adaptive response.\", \"Maybe around this area or maybe about other areas as well, it doesn't. It's okay. If you have other problems you'd want to apply the model to, but certainly around this issue of the childcare versus the work performance. That's the real struggle that's going on right now inside of you. Is that right?\", \"Do you think you'd be able to have that completed? next week?\", \"Okay. So we'll leave it there and I'll see you next week.\", \"Thanks, ma'am.\", 'I am doing well, thanks for asking. I want to give you a brief assessment to help measure functions like memory and thinking. Is that okay with you?', \"All right. For the first part of this assessment, we're going to be handing the sheet back and forth. Okay, I have a table there, so you can write on it. half a second part. I'll get that out of your way. I'll work on some other parts of it. Okay, that sounds good?\", \"All right. So let's take a look at this section right here. I have my finger pointed, please draw a line going from a number to a letter in ascending order. So I want you to begin here and draw a line from one that's a than the two and so on and here?\", 'thank you. I want you to copy this drawing as accurately as you can in the space below.', 'Thank you. So in this empty space here like to draw a clock, put in all the numbers and set the time to five past hour', 'Thank you for joining us. Can you tell me the name of this animal?', 'what the name of this animal?', 'and the name of that animal?', \"Thank you. This is a memory test. I'm going to read a list of words that you will have to remember now, and later on, listen carefully. When I'm through, tell me as many words as you can remember, it does not matter in what order you said. Truck, Banana, Violin, Born, Green.\", \"Thank you. I'm going to read the same list for a second time. Try to remember and tell me as many words as you can including words you said the first time. Truck, Banana, Violin,  Born, Green\", \"Thank you. I will ask you to recall those words again at the end of the test. I am going to say some numbers when I'm through, repeat them to me exactly as I've said them...3 2 9 6 5\", \"Thank you. Now I'm going to say some more numbers, but when I'm through, you must repeat them to me in the backwards order. 8 5 2\", 'Thank you.  Now I asked you to count by subtracting seven from 90 and then keep subtracting seven from your answer until I tell you to stop.', 'correct', \"that's good. Thank you. I'm going to read you a sentence, repeat it after me, exactly as I say it. A bird can fly into closed windows when it's dark and windy.\", \"Thank you.

You can say, any kind of word you want except for proper nouns, like Bob or Boston, numbers, or words that begin with the same sound, but have a different suffix for example, love lover loving. I will tell you to stop after one minute. Are you ready?', 'Now tell me as many words as you can think of the begin with the letter S?', 'Tell me how a carrot and a potato are like?', 'Can you tell me how a diamond and Ruby are like?', 'I read some words to you earlier, which I asked you to remember. Tell me as many of those words as you can remember,', \"Can you tell me today's date?\", 'tell me what day of week it is ?', \"Tell me what place we're in right now.\", \"and what city we're in ?\", 'Susan, thank you very well.', 'Yeah. Just okay.', \"All right. Okay, so I want to refresh your memory and I've got my notes here. Do you mind if I refer to my notes?\", 'yeah.', \"I'm wondering what you could have done in the world.\", 'And so because of the not exercising, did it make any difference in your marijuana usage this week?', 'Okay. Okay. So how would you tie those two things together By not running?', \"Yeah, yeah. So when you reflect back now on last week, and the rain coming down, and it was cold, I'm wondering if there was a way that you could change your perception about that, such that it wouldn't stop you from running. What do you think?\", 'Mm hmm, that would be a great idea. That would be an excellent idea.', 'So it was it was difficult to cut them out of your life? Last week?', 'And  you tell me more but what was difficult about it,', \"So you did it sounds like you didn't want to hurt their feelings.\", 'by them thinking that you were going to avoid them.', 'And so as a result of this what what happened?', 'So because you were worried about them thinking that you were trying to avoid them, you ended up using marijuana. Is that correct?', \"And I'm wondering how you could do that differently this week.\", 'And what would that involve trying harder not to go see them?', 'Yeah. Sometimes it is that simple is just making that commitment. yourself and just drawing the line. And do you have any friends that do not use marijuana that you could kind of associate with?', \"Okay. How about motivated on a scale of one to 10? Would you say you are to kind of reignite friendships with people that don't smoke pot?\", \"Okay. So you're still, you're still a little iffy about you about whether you want to associate with those friends again, but I have to ask you, Bruce, what do you what made you say three instead of one?\", \"I think that's great insight that you're able to see that moving towards The friends that don't smoke pot and making the effort to do that is actually going to enhance your life incredibly. And when you associated with the friends that didn't smoke pot in the past, what kind of things did you do?\", 'Yeah. Was it fun to be with them?', 'So you can recall living a healthier life then and having fun outdoors and basically having a healthier life overall, without using the pot.', \"Sometimes it's good to remember having those good times with the friends that didn't smoke the pot because it makes you realize that you don't really need it. And I think that's a great, I think that's a great idea.\", \"Okay, so you had some second thoughts about that. You're excited about it and last week's session, but after you had a chance to reflect upon it, you kind of realized that it wasn't getting a dog was not the best Thanks for you,\", \"I think that's wise to recognize that right up front, I'm given the research on pets any kind of pet, and how it helps people sustained from alcohol and drug usage. I'm wondering if there is another option that you might consider.\", \"I'm thinking, do you like pets that aren't don't require such a commitment?\", 'Because a dog is the dog is a large commitment.', 'Hey, snakes ! fish, that would definitely be a star these animals that you like.', \"All right, I think it's important that you have an animal that you like and that you can relate to. Alright, so in the final goal was to find and join a support group for people that were trying to be abstinent from marijuana. How did you make out with that?\", 'So you made the effort to go and you went', \"And so you didn't stay the whole time.\", \"And so you left early because you felt you didn't feel and you they were the bottom of the barrel and you're still higher functioning.\", \"I can definitely understand I'm wondering if there is any purpose for you joining some sort of support group to help you. what Do you think?\", 'And what might be some positives that you would get out of the support group?', \"So you're you're saying that the past of being in a support group would be that you'd get a chance to relate to other people who are on that same journey, and to have connections with other people. And again, I can send you information that will show you that that just these two items alone are incredibly helpful for not only decreasing or being abstinent from pot, but from increasing the feel good hormones in your body, the connection and the relating to other people. It might be similar when you were younger, you had mentioned last week that you were a hockey player. And so you had support that was sort of like the team was sort of like a support group. I'm wondering if you could relate to people in head connections and wondering if you could see a support group as a team.\", 'And do you remember when you were playing hockey, how it felt to be encompassed in that team?', \"It gave. And that's because of those good feeling hormones that come in neurotransmitters that come throughout your body when you have those connections. So how committed do you think you are? If I were to send you a list of support groups? So you could try out some others? Where there weren't the bottom of the barrel? As you say, there? how committed Do you think that you would be trying out at least two of them this coming week?\", 'Wow. What made you say an eight rather than a four, five was just', 'So you thought How you remembered. You remember how you felt when you were on the team and how it gave you that sense of connection?', \"I love that analogy. Good thinking. It's thinking, Bruce. That's excellent. Wow. Well, just to summarize, today, you came in, you had made some progress, but you had some stumbling blocks. You have decided that whether it's rain or shine, you're going to run anyway, because you're going to have you raincoat and you're going to embrace more of your positive friends rather than the friends that are not such a good influence on you and getting a pet rather than getting it Dog, you're going to look into getting a snake or what was the other thing?\", \"Okay. And in terms of a support group, I will send you a list of support groups. And you feel that on a scale of one to 10, that you're about an eight, and actually carrying through and trying out two of these support groups, because of the hockey team analogy. Great job. So overall, how would you rate today's session?\", 'And if we were to put it on a scale of one to 10,', 'out of eight. All right, we did get in if we did an eight.', 'way to go.', 'All right. Thanks', \"My sense is that you're trying to say something and then you just kind of almost like gave up there.\", 'Are you feeling angry at me?', \"Right. So, you know, I understand that you're pissed in general. But are you angry at me? I mean, it sounds to my senses here that you're feeling angry at me right now. If you are. I really want to know about it.\", \"yeah, you're sounding really exasperated to me. How does it feel to tell me about this?\", \"Okay, so I want to push you too hard. But can you say any more about that while you're what's uncomfortable bother. So I mean, I do understand that it's uncomfortable. I mean,\", \"So, I mean, part of it sounds like is you're concerned that I'm going to feel like you're blaming me.\", \"sounds really important, right? It sounds like you're you know, it's hard to say this. But you're you know, you're feeling angry of the maybe you feeling disappointed? You're feeling all alone. Yeah, like you can't even really talk with me about this.\", 'Okay.', \"Okay, so let's so at least it's out there. Right.\", \"Right. So you're handling it to the best of your ability. But there's still these these thoughts that are coming out. Kind of encouraging you to second guess your judgment?\", 'Maybe what if, what if the worst happens?', \"So it speaks back to your competency as a professional again. So that's, that seems to be court this. I think Here are several things you talk about seem to connect back to. Are you capable to be in this field? And should you be trusted?\", \"So coming back to thinking there are errors and thinking that all people make. And when these errors become repetitive and you can kind of see them applied in more than one areas of his life. We refer to that as a cognitive distortion. Okay? It's not bad or good. It's just how people think. It's just patterns that people fall into. And there are several different cognitive distortions, there's several patterns that we kind of see. come up often in this work, right as a counselor, wondering, in the situation where you're thinking, the worst possible outcome is unbearable, or likely or both. If you may be really focusing and emphasizing on that, to the exclusion of other evidence that suggests you've made a good decision. I see you're really focused on the negative outcome, the worst possible and maybe even unlikely outcome. And maybe not weighing all the evidence with the same weight, like you're putting more weight on the negative pay, that kind of makes sense.\", 'This is frustrating for you. Yeah. The self doubt is worrying.', \"I do well, thanks for asking. How'd you do this week?\", 'postponed gratification. Yeah,', 'so it sounds like you were able to maintain waiting 10 minutes to smoke marijuana. At least in most cases. It was rough.', \"So it was it was difficult for you, but most cases, you're able to pull off the 10 minutes. Mm hmm. That sounds like there's a few instances where you're able to hold it off longer because something else kind of Yeah, came up.\", \"so another activity presented itself and You've forgotten with marijuana.\", 'So have your feelings about marijuana change since we last talked?', 'Tell me about that.', 'So you still you still believe you should have the right to smoke marijuana?', \"But at the same time, you want to go back to work. And if I remember, right, you're the person that you could go work for. I guess you know them right. Yeah, it's my uncle, your uncle, and you need to be cleaned for was about two months.\", 'So', \"you have kind of opposing forces here, right? You have your enjoyment of marijuana. And then you, you know, that's something you like you don't wanna give up. And you believe you have a right to do that. But then there's that job.\", \"So it doesn't seem fair to you. But she recognizes the reality of your situation.\", 'So it really does come down in your instance to marijuana use or appointment.', \"So you're not happy about that choice.\", \"And kind of what we did with the postpone gratification was just really just ask you to wait 10 minutes and you were able to do that. And more, although it's difficult,\", \"It's difficult for you.\", 'So', 'I asked you to track the number of times you smoke marijuana. Did you really track that over the last week?', 'Yeah, you remember how many times that was?', \"between 15 and 20. And how many times did something kind of get in the way that's something else come up in that 10 minutes span that distracted you or that you enjoyed\", \"So you can see in that 10 minutes, things can happen. Right things can happen that can help you to avoid the marijuana. Sometimes nothing does and after 10 minutes, use it. And sometimes something does kind of get in the way with a marijuana like distract you or you have another activity that you enjoy and then you didn't use.\", 'So with that in mind', 'you found the experience rough, but was it tolerable?', 'was a bit Do you think for this next week? We could try postpone gratification from 10 minutes to 20 minutes?', 'that that is definitely. That is a longer time.', 'Yeah.', 'no compromises. 15 Okay, do you think you could maintain 15 minutes weighing 15?', \"All right, so let's go with 15 minutes, right. So 15 minutes, you know, as compared to 10. I'll give you five extra minutes that something could happen that could distract you. And you wouldn't use that instance, right. There's also, you know, to constructively use that time, you could consider alternatives like like you mentioned walking right. You could use that time and start walking. Yeah. Anything else that that you like, maybe in the past on occasion when you want to use marijuana, but she didn't have anything available? What would you do instead?\", \"or should it be okay, well, so perhaps in that 15 minute time period that that timer you're delaying using marijuana, you could start watching the show.\", 'At the under 15 minutes, you might end up using marijuana or you might want to continue watching the show. So do you see kind of how it works? Like is it making sense to you the postponing?', \"And maybe if we're successful to 15?\", \"Who knows? We'll move it up from there.\", \"how it goes the 15? Yeah, I'll see how that goes. You know, I'm hoping. And I hope this kind of makes sense that there'll be a point where you will be really interfering with the vast majority of the times that use marijuana. Like because you're giving yourself that many more opportunities, the longer you wait. Right. The more minutes you wait, the more opportunities for something else to get in the way so to speak. And probably what you'll see, just like you saw this last because you're, you know, you used marijuana less frequently, just by waiting the 10 minutes. Even though you described as difficult I'm sure it was, but there were a few times where it kind of worked out\", \"So, I think that planning something for that time would be helpful. And try to plan something 15 minutes, even if you fully intend to beyond the 15 to go right and use, I think it's still useful plan something in there. You never know that might take you. Or you might end up walking or watching TV or doing something else that would distract you or pull you away from the marijuana use. Okay. So that's like a plan.\", 'Sounds like a plan?', \"All right. We'll go with that. And I'll see you next week. Okay, thank you.\", \"I am not doing bad, Thanks for asking. I'd like to give you an assessment to test your thinking and memory. Is that right?\", \"So I'll be asking you a series of questions. If you could just answer them to the best your ability that'd be great.\", \"Okay. What is today's date?\", \"What is today's year?\", 'What is the month?', 'what day is today ?', 'Can you also tell me what season it is?', \"Can you tell me the name of the building that we're in right now?\", 'What floor, are we on?', 'What city are we in?', 'What County are we in ?', 'And what state are we in ?', \"Okay. I'm going to ask you to memorize few objects. So read them to ask you to repeat them back to me. The objects are ball, flag and tree.  Can you give those back to me ?\", 'Thank you. I would like you to begin with the number 100 and count backward by seven and continue to do so until i try to stop.', \"That's good. Thank you. I would like you to spell the word world backwards.\", 'Can you recall the three words I read to you few minutes ago?', 'Thank you.', 'Can you tell me what this is?', \"I'm going to read a phrase to like you to repeat it back to me. The phrase is no ifs, ands, or buts. Repeat that back to me.\", 'Are you right handed or left handed?', \"I'd like you to take this paper in your right hand, fold in half and then put it on the floor.\", \"Thank you. I'm gonna hold up a sign. As instructions I'll point to it. I'd like you to follow those instructions.\", \"Thank you. On the left side chair, you'll find a clipboard if you could retrieve that.\", 'spaced toward the bottom. Like you to write a sentence ?', \"Thank you. You'll see on that same paper, there's an image in the same area wrote that sentence. Can you copy that image form?\", 'Good, thank you.', 'Thank you.', \"You're 20 Okay, where do you live?\", 'you live at home? Who do you live with?', 'Okay, so you live with mom, dad and sister. what do you do for work?', \"Okay, so you came to me. It's See me cuz I'm a Doctor.\", 'Okay, are your mom dad and sister here?', \"Okay, so I'll I'll let you go back to them in a few minutes. But let's just get through a few questions\", \"So Victor, tell me, how's your sleep? And what about Have you experiencing any lack of joy?\", \"You need to calm down, victory stay in your seat. I'm gonna have to call security.\", 'you are you yelling at me right now and I need you not to yell. Are you on any medications right now?', 'yes or no. Are you on any medications?', \"okay. I need you to bring me a list of your medications later. So I'm going to give you a prescription for an antidepressant medication. Are you bringing home to your mom and show it to her and then get it filled?\", \"Okay, so I'm just I'm just gonna go to my computer and put it in and then I'll be a receptionist will put you off the medication. Okay, so good luck Victor.\", \"Hi Victor, I'm Dr. Sawyer. Hi. I'm a psychiatrist. Do you know what a psychiatrist is?\", \"Okay. So a psychiatrist is a doctor who deals with people who are feeling sad or mad, different feelings that they might have. We'll talk for a little bit and we'll talk about some things that might have been difficult in your life over the past little bit. And our goal is to try to make things see how we can make things a little bit easier for you.\", 'So you feel pretty unheard.', \"so you said you've been feeling pretty sad. How long have you been feeling sad for ?\", 'How long have you had this teacher for?', 'So have you been feeling sad for this entire four years or a shorter period of time?', 'So has it been a couple of weeks? A couple months? A couple days?', \"So Victor, I want to tell you some of my thoughts of what I think is going on, but I want to invite your sister in because I need to find out a little bit about your medical history. So I'm just going to get her and then I'll come back. Okay.\", \"So, I've been talking to Victor he's been telling me about how his how he's had less interest in things. He's having trouble sleeping. And he's, he's not he's feeling sad all the time. And it does sound like he's been suffering from what we call a major depression. There's a couple of treatments that I want to talk about what you know what medications Victor's on?\", \"Thank you.  Okay, so on this list it says about sort of what medical illnesses he's had and hospitalizations and surgeries as well. So there's a couple of treatments for for depression. One is medication and one is also doing some interventions within the school and within the family. And there's a lot of things to think about, but it seems like things in the school have been really not going well. And that's been a major contribution to his to sadness.\", \"I'm doing well. Thanks for asking. So you're here at the agency today to seek counseling services?\", 'your boss said, Sure?', 'she wants you to come over and talk about your relationship with your coworkers?', 'Okay, what would you mean by higher, like, your ideas', \"Okay, so they were unable to reach your level of expression for this was like a project you're working on? And your boss recognized this difference, and thought that, that the counselor may be helpful. Yeah?\", \"Again, you stay at their level. So are you meaning again, that they're kind of below you with skills?\", 'Okay, so counseling can help you bridge that gap to go to communicate more effectively.', \"When you say you're here at the first level,\", 'How would you plan on accomplishing that?', \"Okay, so it sounds like you're you have a lot of stress.\", 'And maybe, from your understanding that people were just getting jealous because you seem to succeed in so many things.', \"So calcium help you to relate to them in a way that so how would they have a more productive way? How would they describe you? You know, given this level of difference on this, you're talking about how would they describe you, if I were to ask them, if I could ask them. Could you describe sample?\", 'Would It be easier?', \"All those stuff. That's what your coworkers would include?\", 'yeah. Things that maybe detract from them.', \"does it frustrates you that you're not calling for every task?\", 'So they recognize you most of the time.', 'How long have you been with this particular employer?', \"Can you tell me about the job you've had prior like what happened there?\", 'You want to you want to shoot higher. You want to accomplish something greater?', \"more. So more stuff. You've already achieved some level of popularity.\", 'Alright, so your last ploy or the one before the place you work now, you just outgrew that. Can you tell me how that interaction went? Like? Did you quit? Or did they encourage you to leave? Like, what happened to kind of the last moments of that job?', 'So you initiate it and you quit. At the same time. They had a few issues with type issues they have.', 'So I have to quit the pursuit you to come', 'You predicted that when you left', 'So what did you tell them when they offered you', 'So you rejected them at that point, okay.', \"It's your boss putting, I mean, she encouraged you to come here today. Is she putting any pressure on you? Like, is this something that's strongly encouraged mandatory?\", \"So she's trying to help you for the future. Another advancement. So Sam, I'm going to get you on the calendar is to see a counselor open later this week. Is that work for you? okay? That does. So I'll get you set up for that. I really appreciate you taking the time with me it was helpful origin to see a counselor and we'll go from there.\", 'Right.', \"Okay. And so what happened from there then just tell me a little bit about what's happened so that I'm up to speed.\", 'Okay. So in between the scan happening and the second scan happening Was it the department?', 'And did they give you an idea why they needed to do extra?', 'Okay. And I do have any thoughts yourself or any worries about why they were calling back?', \"So just tell me a little bit about what symptoms you've been having them but we do have a scan result here today and there's some scuffs on it.\", \"I just like to make sure that I know what's been happening to you first of all, and then we'll go into detail\", 'Yeah.', 'Okay. Okay. And so do you still have pain at the abdomen?', 'Okay. Well, as I said, you scan result has come through to me today.', \"I'm afraid I'm afraid there is something that's potentially a little bit worrying on it.\", 'Yeah.', 'Well, if I take you back to the first scan first. So what it appears that that showed is that there was something suspicious on what we call the pancreas gland', \"Yeah. So there is a gland that sort of the top of your abdomen, which is quite closely evolved, right, and called the pancreas. And when they did the ultrasound scan, which is a good scan, but isn't particularly detailed, right, there was something on it that they saw that they wanted a bit more info\", \"So that's why they called you back for the second scan\", \"which was a CT scan, which is a detail that we're likely to be talking about.\", 'So the second scan, I showed that there definitely is something on your pancreas.', 'When I say something, what we worry about is whether or not this could be a cancer', \"I'm really sorry to have to break it to you like this, but I felt that it was important that as soon as I knew that I communicated that to you. So, I mean, I know that I've just dropped a big bombshell on you.\", 'Have you got any Any questions in a minute? Have you got anything that you can query?', \"And it depends. And basically a pancreas is a brand that sort of sits at the top of the abdomen, as I said, and it controls some of the sort of the hormones, the fluids that your body prefers the body. Because it's at the back of the abdomen, often we don't know very much about it until it starts causing a bit of a problem, like your pain that you've been getting. So that probably explains why you've not had many other symptoms.\", \"And the answer is, I don't know what could be done about it. But we need to ask a specialist  what we usually do. This situation is asked especially today to see what has happened, think about what was cooking. Right? Do they agree that it could be potentially cancer and how do we find out what it definitely is\", \"So I understand that I've just thrown a whole lot of information at you and\", \"I mean, is there is there anybody that you could that you could bring in with them? Oh, quit I went on a bit of a chat maybe tomorrow when you've had a bit. Bit more time.\", \"I mean, I think it's important to say that we don't know for definite what this is. We have to imagine that it is something like a cancer until we can prove what is right. So we do everything very quickly. Yeah, try and get some answers. Right. But we don't know any definite nothing certain in a minute. But I do appreciate that. I've just given you a little bit of time. So my door is open and yes. Okay. Have you got any questions?\", \"I've taken the liberty of printing off a little bit of something about pancreatic cancer, if that's what it is.\", \"some of it's a little bit a little bit scary. And as I said, we don't know, nothing certain yet. I wonder if you might want to come back to see me. So what this does is it just explains a little bit about what the pancreas is right?\", 'And it talks about cancer in general. The types of ways in which you can affect the pancreas', \"How we do it and how we work out what we do about it talks about the different types of scans that you've had and this one is CTS.\", 'And then depending on what they find, yeah, it gives you a brief run through of the different types of treatment.', 'did you want to have a read through this and then Maybe tomorrow.', \"I'll see you tomorrow.\", \"I know when we spoke last time, you had some goals you want to talk about this time? You're ready to do that?\", 'What do you have in mind?', \"frustated Trying to lose the weight. Now you'd said before that you had a specific number of pounds of specific amount of weight to lose. You still have that in mind?\", 'Right, and you tried before? And what do you think got in the way?', 'Yeah.', 'Loss of focus. So you start trying to lose the weight and your focus gets disrupted.', \"Alright, so you know, how to lose weight. And you know, you can lose weight. But your focus is a little off when you're trying and that's causing the problem. Could we break that goal of losing 20 pounds down into smaller units? Like say, five pounds\", \"It's just something you can do.\", 'for once a week.', 'You mentioned the loss of focus is one problem. How about motivation, you feel motivated to move through all those steps like five pounds and five pounds and so on.', 'a little bit of that something extra to help you stay motivated.', 'Okay. So some sort of activity or item that you enjoy, that you could reserve for when you reach that goal of say that the first five pounds', 'All right. Do you have the activity or item in mind? We could put in place as something you could reward yourself with?', \"Well, there's a few ways we could do it. We could do that. So you reach five pounds. And then you can give yourself that reward work could be for something you do every day. If that day you're successful in eating the way you want, he would you think would motivate you more?\", \"Yes, you know, each and every day as you're trying to lose weight. You're aware. When that day comes to close if you had a successful night, they were a less than successful day, right? If you have a successful day, then you could engage in an activity or receiving items that we work out in advance that, you know, would motivate you.Right?\", \"So let's let's do that. On a day, you know, towards the evening. When you know, you have had a successful day and by what time would you know, in the evening?\", \"Let's say some Okay, say so by 7pm at that point in terms of the day being successful or less than successful, you know, okay, right at 7pm, you're aware. And at that point, if you have met your call, then you have a you have a TV show that you maybe it's recorded on a TV or something you would watch, okay? And if you were not as successful you would write. So I'd be like something to keep you motivated about the day because you really want to watch that show. Right? A lot of fun. Do you think that structure, that kind of behavioral strategy would give you enough motivation to have successful days so it's process?\", \"And this is something you could also track. Right? You could write down days that are successful days or lessons less than successful. And we could look at if there's any patterns, maybe weekends are harder, because they're easier or something where we can identify days that have maybe more triggers or we're less motivated.\", \"Okay, there's the potential for every day to be different with what you're exposed to, and what temptations in terms of different foods, what your schedules like maybe for busier things easier. So we can We can look at those different patterns. And we can add levels to this plan. Okay, but for now we'll go with the TV show that you'll watch sometime after seven, seven, you evaluate how you did, sometime after that. watch the show, okay? That's like a plan.\", \"day by day, okay, this and five pound increments, okay, four times to get to your goal. 20 pounds. Okay. Sounds good. So far. So, we'll give that a shot. And we'll take a look at the pattern that emerges, support everything. I say, write everything down. Okay, probably at around seven is a good time. When you know kind of day ahead, write down kind of what happened that day and whether you've had success or not. And bring that in. I'll see you again week. So give us I'll give you seven, seven days to work with. Okay? And we'll look at that log of events. And we'll reevaluate each week.\", 'starts tonight, okay.', \"So we'll give that a shot and I'll see it a week.\", 'ok will tell me about the papers.', 'Alright, so you, you have a five page paper, you sit down to work on it. You have the references, you get that part taken care of that then sounds like you kind of wander off a little bit.', 'Yeah. Okay. And then what happens after you are done wandering a little bit?', \"So you are you're finishing assignment on time. So the promise of lateness\", 'You get done?', \"So it's really the how the time breaks out isn't working out well for you.\", \"You'd rather not be doing it at the last moment.\", \"So these so these activities that you're engaging in between when you start the work and before you start writing, also regarding the references before you start writing. You said check an email.\", 'And other kind of sounds like unplanned small activities.', \"These aren't particularly engaging activities like something you need to do. No at that moment.\", 'So like distracted,', \"And then there's a moment you kind of catch yourself and realize you haven't really started writing.\", \"is too late. Yeah, so you're consuming time there. Alright. So you have a few different levels of activity. Here you have the paper, which it sounds like you're okay writing but you're you're maybe not highly motivated to write.\", 'but you seem to be getting the references done. Okay.', \"You collect the material, and then the writing part. That's the difficult part. And then you have these behaviors. In the middle, which you enjoy doing a little, but they're not something that\", 'But these behaviors still fulfill purpose they they do delay the writing of the paper.', \"You may not be fully aware of that in a moment. But then you kind of become aware of that later that that's the purpose that those behaviors accomplished was that they kept you distracted from writing. Alright. So the the writing of papers and activity, that's a behavior that's something you're not really looking forward to. What's the behavior That was an activity that you really do look forward to, you know, think about and some level of engagement is there.\", \"So so you're excited about this television show and you how you have the episodes already recorded. And maybe one of the reasons you can't find the time is because the time you're using between the two parts of writing this paper.\", \"Right. So let's let's try this. When you when you do write to paper, you're really writing it. The writing part, not the preparing part, but the writing part kind of all at the end. Right, getting it done this the night before it's due. All right. So I want to try a couple different behavioral strategies here. Okay. And these might be similar to what we tried before working with motivation. One is I think that it might be helpful and I want you let me know if I'm right here to break if it's a five page paper to break it up into more than one night. Because right now, functionally, at least a lot of what you're doing on the last night, okay. would be a more comfortable pace like Like, for example, how long does it take you to write one page?\", 'So around an hour to an hour and a half? You can complete one page. Edited proof read?', \"Okay. So it would take about five days. To complete the whole paper, if you did an hour and a half each day, an hour to one I haven't checked. Okay. But how much time do you have from when the papers assigned to when it's due?\", 'I guess around 10 days. Yeah.', 'pretty good time. So if you could work without distraction, you would be done by around 730 at the latest with this one page.', \"no distractions. Just one page. Yeah. All right. So let's talk about the the episodes, the TV episodes that you want to watch. Okay? How long are they,\", 'And once a time that you could watch those, you get the maximum enjoyment out of watching, like no distractions, I guess,', \"Okay. So eight o'clock, so really good time for you to maximize\", \"you know, that's a great motivator for you. And I want to try to use it as a motivator. Kind of like a reward. Okay, so I'd like you to try to do is when you start, like when you get all these papers assigned when the five, five page papers, pick the five nights that you want to work on it. Okay, it could be Monday through Friday or whatever works for you.\", \"All right, clearly within the 10 day window, though, all right, so five days within the 10 day window, do you have to turn in and then set that time at six o'clock is when you're going to start because that's a good time for you to work.\", \"Yeah, that's sure.\", \"Yeah. And not waste that time in the middle. Yeah. Right. That's, that's really eating more time and your show takes\", 'Does this make sense to you understand kind of,', \"And I think that's a that's a helpful way to think about it. And that's, that's the cognitive part of this. So this is a kind of this is a behavioral strategy because we've talked about these in the past, right? This is behavioral strategy, the cognitive pieces, when you find yourself wandering, I think you have to detect that. And you I think you have some level awareness that's happening. Yeah, you have to detect that and say, I want to watch my show, and we're looking forward to it.\", \"And that's your motivation to move through the paper. And then you know, when eight o'clock comes, okay.\", \"Very good. So let's try that for. I'll see again in roughly two weeks.\", 'All right. Thank you. Thanks.', \"Yeah me too thanks for asking. I understand you've been having some difficulties that brought you in to our agency.\", \"You're worried about your drinking. Tell me about your drinking.\", \"So sometimes at work, you've been having cravings for alcohol and the other There are times when you will have a craving?\", 'So other than that feeling of having the craving, is there anything you do after you have a craving?', 'How much do you drink?', 'Is this when you work in a day?', \"So when you're having cravings at work, you're not drinking there?\", 'Right. So tell me about your typical alcohol consumption week.', \"You're worried that the craving is indicating you have an alcohol problem?\", \"Have you ever tried to cut down your drinking and you're unable to do so?\", 'You spend a lot of time trying to obtain alcohol.', \"How about in terms of your responsibilities? Have you failed to uphold any responsibilities because you're drinking? Or you have any social problems because you're drinking.\", \"It doesn't cause social problems. Do you find yourself giving up important activities because you're drinking instead?\", \"So thinking about it, maybe still some craving, but you're still going. You're still participating.\", 'Are you engaging in activities that are dangerous?', 'Drinking and driving?', \"There's nothing like that. Yeah.\", 'Do you have any medical or mental health problems in general?', \"Do you find that you have to increase the amount of alcohol you're drinking to get the same effect?\", \"all right, and you've been drinks you save a drink about the same amount each time you drink. Have you noticed that the effect has been diminished, like you're not getting the same effect from the alcohol?\", 'Goes same way. Yeah. Have you ever noticed any symptoms when you stop drinking, like withdrawal?', \"Like when you stop using alcohol, are you finding that you're anxious, depressed, you have physical reactions like that.\", \"Okay, Jackie, I appreciate you. Tell me about what's going on and answer my questions. If you're okay with it, I'll get you in to see a counselor. I'll get that scheduled. And we can go from there.\", 'Cool. Okay. So I just wanted to ask, did you receive that information pack that was sent out to you in the mail?', 'Fabulous. Okay. So would you mind if we just spend a few minutes going through that together now?', 'So I guess something really important that I would like to draw your attention to first of all, is this issue here of confidentiality, okay. Basically, everything that you and I talk about together in therapy is just between you and I, however, because I am a professional psychologist, the things that we discussed, I may need to share with my supervisor, okay.', \"Yeah, that's right. Yep. Yeah. There are a few special circumstances though, where I may have to break confidentiality. That is if you tell me that you might be of harm to yourself or someone else. Okay. If you tell me that you've been involved in a serious crime, okay for us. Somebody else wishes to access the information that we talked about in the context of legal proceedings and they take it off subpeona I'm required to give that information then okay. But of course, if any of these things ever did come up, I would discuss these with you first. Okay, that'd be good. Okay. All right. All right. So something else I just would like to draw your attention to here as well. It's just our fee here at the clinic. Yes. Which as we discussed on the phone is $20.\", 'Okay. And I understand from time to time that things can come up as well and that you might have to reschedule one of your appointment. We just asked that if you could provide us with about 24 hours notice beforehand shot so that gives us a chance to be able to set up another appointment time.', 'Okay. Did you have any other questions about anything that you read on that shape there?', \"Yeah. Okay. So if you wouldn't mind just popping your signature at the bottom there. Thanks.\", \"Yeah, I can understand that it can be a bit confronting and scary The first time you come along. Yeah. So I guess, I mean, just to give you a bit of an idea about how I like to work with clients, is that I like it to be a collaborative approach so that the two of us get to work together on new problems and concerns that you're having at the moment. Okay.\", \"So the purpose of today's session, I guess, would be for me to get more of an understanding of what's happening for you lately. All right, and give us a chance to get to know each other a little bit more. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that's really good. Yeah. And at the end, we can sort of have a touch base again and see how we went for today and whether we'd like to take it on from there.\", \"Yes, yeah, exactly. Yeah. Okay. So I mean, just to start off with then I guess, are there any other things that you've tried apart from coming to therapy and As some ways to help you cope with what's happening for you.\", \"Yeah. We've been really keeping it to yourself and it's quite a big step for you to reach out to to someone today.\", \"Okay, I guess to start off with him. Would you like to tell me a little bit more about what's been happening for you?\", \"I'm doing well. Thanks for asking. So doing great. I noticed today your brother rush in. And he has some concerns about how you remove a spin.\", \"Right. So you're feeling pretty good. And you have been for about a week? Yeah. Have you? Do you feel like your sleep habits have changed?\", \"No, it's you're sleeping less but you don't feel tired at all.\", 'Do you Find yourself more easily distracted by anything. things around you.', 'You mentioned you get a lot of things done at work. How about at home?', \"if you're accomplishing you're accomplishing a lot. Know, when your brother can brush in, he'd mentioned some shopping and that's one of the things he was certain about.\", 'You remember how much you spent', 'Dude, I feel like you spent more than you usually would spend a trip to the mall.', 'So have you ever had a time in the past when you felt this way where you felt really good?', \"Life's fall into place. So you're feeling pretty good. You feel like things are On your way\", 'you get a lot accomplished.', 'Any sadness or anything like that?', 'A change in appetite.', 'You seem to have a good amount of energy. Any feelings of worthlessness?', 'Any thoughts of death or dying?', 'drug and alcohol use?', 'no medical conditions.', 'Have you ever had time in the past when you felt depressed?', 'to new you. Yep. So do you know what happened? With the depression the past? Like, did you end up hospital or being treated some other way?', 'Just no treatment?', 'But you believe you were depressed?', \"Now we're back then. Did you see or hear things that other people couldn't see or hear?\", \"not now. We're back then.\", 'Okay.', \"All right, Sherry. answering these questions has been helpful to me. I appreciate it. I'm going to get you over to see a counselor. Just a few moments.\", \"I know that you're feeling pretty good, but I'd like them to talk to you for just a bit.\", 'Okay, thanks for', 'Yeah, you said that you worry that you visibly shake.', 'And are there any other things that you worry that people will notice?', \"So it sounds like you have quite a strong mental image of how you see yourself when you're in these social situations. Yeah. You say you go read you shake. Is there anything else that you think that you do? I mean, describe yourself. How do you think you look, when you're in these situations, just\", 'And is there anything that you do to try and kind of defend against these things to manage these problems?', 'So you focus on something you grip onto that Camera. Do you make eye contact with people?', 'Okay, so you also avoid eye contact? Is there anything else that you do to manage the sweating For example,', 'Okay', 'What do you think would happen if you stopped doing these things? If you stopped gripping onto the camera? Or, you know, you start to make eye contact and not looking down? And what do you think would happen?', \"And what I'm thinking now is how do you feel about if we did an experiment to test out your thoughts on what would happen if you stopped doing these things? If we did a bit of a role play where we pretended to enact a situation at work, okay? And if we did this maybe twice and the first time, you do all the things that you normally do, okay and grip onto something, look down. And is there anything else that you do when you're in these situations, these work conversations to try and cope.\", 'Okay, so in the first time, I want you to do those things as much as you normally would, in fact, maybe even slightly more than you normally would.', 'and then the second time, I want you to drop doing those things all together.', 'does that sound okay?', 'And do you? How would you feel about if we filmed this so you could actually see what you looked like?', 'Do you have a camera with you that we can video on?', \"Yeah, yeah, we'll use that in just a sec.\", \"before we do this, then we're just going to fill out this form is because what we're doing now is an experiment. We call it behavioral experiments, see what happens when you change the way that you're behaving?\", \"so the first column says, I need to fill out an experiment to test this thought that you have, so that our experiment is going to be that we do a conversation at work, and who should I play if you're playing yourself in this roleplay? Who should I be?\", 'Okay, so would it work if I was maybe having a wedding and I was hiring?', 'wedding photographer?', 'What kind of problems do you see coming up in this conversation that we have like what we see yourself doing on camera', 'visibly shaking. So how, how much will you be shaking if 100 is like shaking uncontrollably and zero is not shaking at all? How visibly shaking Will you be?', 'Okay. So what was the other thing that you just said?', 'Okay, so go read.', 'And how read will you go? I mean, if we look around this room', \"Okay, thanks. Hello. Yeah, you're going to be as kind of brightly pink as these chairs. Oh, yeah. Okay. So out of 100 then how how pink would you say these chairs are\", 'What else you worried is going to happen when we have these conversations, just', 'Okay, and how stupid out of 100 100 is ridiculously stupid.', 'wow, see worried will happen when you have this conversation. What else might you see on the camera?', 'And how much will you be sweating?', 'I really think like visibly sweating down the face. Yeah.', \"Okay, and what you think will happen the second time around when you stop kind of doing the things you normally do to cope when you maybe start to make eye contact. You're not gripping on something.\", 'How much worse? slightly worse, like twice as bad?', 'Okay,', 'right. Can you give me your phone number?', \"And yeah, yeah, it's probably best. Okay.\", 'okay. So', 'I was just wondering if I could talk to you about maybe doing my wedding', \"I suppose I like lots of shots of our family and our friends quite a lot of natural shots. You know, talking when they're having drinks. And\", \"Yeah, shots there's going to be a summer wedding. So we like I like a lot of outdoors shots and if possible, you know, if it's not raining, that would be quite nice and Yeah, quite some arty ones if that's possible.\", 'So, have you got anything that you could show me about your past work?', \"Okay, great. All right, let's do the second one now. Okay. Okay, you put down the bottle and make eye contact. Okay.\", 'Hi. So I was just wondering if I could speak to you about doing my wedding photography.', \"and I'd like kind of lots of shots of family and friends and quite a lot of natural shots, you know,\", \"Yeah, cuz it's gonna be a summer wedding and Okay, you know, weather dependent. Of course. Yeah, it would be really great if we could kind of get lots of shots you know, outdoors. Okay. Yeah, people chatting and maybe some quite arty ones as well.\", 'Have you got anything that you could show me about your past work?', \"Let's pause it there. Okay. Ryan's gonna give you this back now to look up. Okay. And I just want you to watch that. Okay. And then we'll chat about it in a moment. Okay.\", 'So, if we just go back to the things that you predicted, then you said that you thought you were going to shake visibly shake. Could you see yourself shaking on a video', 'So you said that you were going to shake 90 out of 100? How much shaking Would you say that you saw there?', 'Okay. And you said that you were going to go red, or pink as pink as these chairs? 90 out of 100. Did you notice yourself going pink?', 'Okay, you said that you were worried that you were going to say something stupid, you know, at 90 out of 100 Did you know yourself say anything stupid?', \"actually it was. So you thought you were going to be like 90 say something that was 90% stupid. That's really quite strong. I mean, in the end did you pick up in Anything that could be maybe put that as a zero?\", \"And you said that you thought you were going to be sweating? Yeah. And that you're going to be visibly sweating. Did you? Did you notice yourself sweating in the end?\", 'thought again, you thought you were going to be like night out, like seriously visibly sweating. So what what score would you actually give it in the end?', 'Mm hmm. You also said that you thought it was going to be twice as bad when you stop choosing your you know your normal strategies.', 'What did you notice watching that video?', \"okay that's all for now. Thank you so much for your time\", 'Okay. Would it help to time the deep breathing with reviewing each one of those bullet points?', \"I don't know how many bullet points you'd have in a presentation. Maybe you'd have 10 or 20. Yeah, depending on how long right so maybe you as you start to review a certain bullet point As you're trying to get it into your memory and think about it, you breathe in really deeply. And then as you continue on, you just let out that breath really slowly,\", \"I thought about it that way. I'm just thinking it'd be some way to structure. So you would, you would get in so many breaths,\", 'Yeah, something that kind of becomes a habit. Okay. Just make sure you keep your bullet points of length. About a few paragraphs. Yeah. But just just a few seconds each. So you can get a good deep breath and, or you could, you know, if you did have a longer bullet point, you could have obviously, several breaths, but just some rhythm that you could kind of grab on to something concrete. Yeah. Because I know that. In that moment, things are probably like you mentioned zoning out and right It becomes very easy to lose your anchors.', \"Yeah, so if you can remember, you know, for a particular bullet point that you want to take three deep breaths. And that might be something you can really have one too. Yeah. And would we kind of cut through that fogginess something could still do. Okay. When's the next presentation in that class that's coming up?\", 'Is that the next presentation you have? Like in all the classes is the one', \"Okay. And that's next Friday. Mm hmm. Do you know where you are in the order? Like for presenting?\", \"not first. And this one's how many minutes\", \"Okay, it's a little shorter than 20 minutes. So you have about a half hour, maybe a little more, if there's time to switch out of kind of sitting there, right. And potential time where you could be anxious. Yes, but also potential time and you could be reviewing the notes your bullet points and breathing.\", \"And saying to yourself, that's so like, kind of self talk, that they're not really paying attention to me anyway. Right. Right. Because that might help reduce that. That anxiety. Yeah. What's one thing you could say to yourself when you're up there?\", 'Okay, so the sort of self talk up there could be I deserve to be here.', \"I've prepared enough. I'm a good student. I deserve to be here.\", 'Is that something that would be helpful to write down and have as part of your notes that you can?', \"Yeah, internally as you because it's not long.\", 'And how much do you believe that those statements are true?', \"Okay, so there's those self talk items. You believe them to be true. Yeah, but you recognize in the moment, and I want you to be aware of this. You might not believe them as much, right? But remember that, you know, we worked on them. Right? You came up with them.\", 'And you believe them now. Right? So try to keep that in your mind as you start to doubt yourself.', \"Then the chaos of anxiety in the words is harder. So the more tasks you can make concrete, and you can write down and you can rehearse, I think the better off you'll be. Okay. I would like to see you your presentations next Friday. Yeah, I would like to see you right before that. So be about a week. Okay for that. Do you have any questions? These are items you can rehearse still even without the presentation, the self talk and write the breathing, and of course preparing. But you have any questions between now and then you think?\", 'Understand kind of the plan to attack that anxiety symptom', \"Right. So, so good. So you have some kind of behavioral pieces. Focus on studying the breathing. And so cognitive pieces that the self talk we talked about, yeah. That you use when you're seated and use when you're at the podium,\", \"And actually presenting. Alright, good. So I'm glad we have a plan going forward. I think that you did a really good job today, helping kind of untangle this and figure out what's going on. And I appreciate that. You were able to really connect with the symptoms and the thoughts and kind of realize how they're related. Yeah. And I feel like this is something that's going to serve you well as you move through this.\", \"All right. So I'll see you in, in a week.\", 'Thanks, Hazel.', \"hanging in there. I understand you've been having some symptoms that have been bothering you can you tell me about those?\", \"So, so a lot of lot of worrying, and how many? How many days? Would you say you're worried a typical week?\", \"So it's very, very distressing for you\", \"And you mentioned it's impacting school\", 'Right? So both at school and at home? Oh,', 'find difficult to control the anxiety.', \"That's affecting in a major way.\", 'So might ask you some other questions that may be tied in with this. Okay. Do you do you use any alcohol or drugs?', \"it's under control. Yeah. How often would you say you drink?\", 'And how much would you So you drink.', 'So just down then', 'times a week.', 'Have you ever had', 'any trauma in your history?', \"she's been on your mind. And when you think about her, what's the feeling that comes up?\", \"Alright, so when you're when you're thinking about her, you're having some sort of worry.\", \"That's been distressing.\", \"Alright, so I'm going to ask you some different symptoms. Let me know if you've had these symptoms as part of what's going on now. Do you feel restless, keyed up or on edge?\", 'Yeah.', 'How about you feel like you get tired easily.', 'Yes. How about do you find your mind going blank or having trouble concentrating?', 'will concentrate.', \"Have you noticed that you're more irritable\", 'cranky? Maybe a little safe.', \"You mentioned you're tense all the time. Is that like a muscle tension.\", 'And tell me about your sleep.', 'So you have difficulty falling asleep. But once you fall asleep', 'Versus sleep has been a big, big problem for you.', 'So I like to get you in to see a counselor. I can probably get you into see one in just a couple of days', \"that'd be helpful. Yes, yes.\", 'And I want to thank you for answering these questions. For me. This has been very helpful.', 'Thanks.', 'Not so good ?', \"what's been going on?\", \"Alright, so they're at the point where anything else happens they discover it and you're on the street.\", 'What are your feelings about being on the street?', \"So there are conflicting feelings here. You don't want to be out in the street. But you don't want to give up the heroin same time.\", 'So you want to stop to avoid the consequences could happen.', 'So this is the first consequence or potential consequences motivated you Right since you started using', 'How strong is the craving to use?', 'Right so when you when you try to cut back, have you tried to cut back?', 'When you did try Did you have the feeling Were you getting sick?', \"have your parents given you any options in terms of like Do they understand that your seems like you're a little dependent on\", \"So they have a solution in a sense for what's going on. silica is like a detox.\", \"okay detox right.  So they have a they have a solution to help get you off the heroin, but there's still, there's still a part of you that doesn't want to go that route.\", \"Right. So there's, there's a few problems here. So So one is can you can you commit to going to detox and the second is, even if you successfully complete that, when you come back out, if you can build void the power\", \"right. So you so really, you're running into them as you walk to your girlfriend's house.\", \"And he's there and the temptations is great. And\", 'in his house?', \"know, feeling so so it's exploiters. As soon as you're walking up to the wall as you're getting ready to pass this house Sumo like to all the way to your girlfriend, you divert to kind of go to his house and you have this feeling of excitement. What's the thought that's going through your mind?\", 'Okay, so you have a you have a few things going on. Do you think like, is your plan right now to go into the detox?', \"let's let's presume for a second that the detox would be successful and you you wouldn't be one even you wouldn't be on heroin coming out of detox.\", \"Are you worried at that point that you'll go right back?\", \"That's that's the point of worry right?\", \"so there's there is a concern that you'll you could, you could go back if you run into them?\", 'If you could stay away from him. You think you increase your chances of being successful?', 'When you plans in terms of going into detox?', 'okay. So it it actually sounds like what your parents have put in place you believe will work. Right? You have confidence that will work. And that your worry is what will you have is when you get out can you avoid it when your friends', \"You don't buy from anybody else other than your friends.\", \"So so that's really becomes the maybe one of your key goals here since since your cake. Sounds like you're committed to the detox part. Right and you know, some reading that incorrectly that that seems to be something you're\", \"So it's it's preparing for life after detox\", \"and avoiding wait for the phrase people places things through with with the addictions or, or substance use. So in this case you need to avoid it would seem your friend we're and and where he lives right which is unfortunately not far from you and in between because houses in between your house and your girlfriend\", \"so is there a way it's may seem a little odd but there's a way to walk around the block where you can completely avoid his house and still get to your girlfriend's house.\", 'She would never even see his house.', \"have other options as well. So there's that option. How about her coming over to where your parents that was that ever happened before?\", 'because she can walk right by the house without problem,', 'and to get to work, do you have to pass his house?', \"So there's kind of some like, really, there's a physical kind of slash behavioral strategy here, which is just physically keeping you away from having to go by his house and sounds like the only reason other than to, to buy and use drugs is to see your girlfriend.\", \"There's an alternative strategy here, right? She She comes to you, or you could go all the way around, and then only round back to return. And to get back and forth to work. You don't have to go by his house at all.\", 'Is there ever a time where he comes to you?', \"And we, you know, we know that there's on my thoughts, we've talked about this before, right, that is on Mac thoughts that lead to feelings and behaviors.\", \"And can you identify a specific thought that may occur or maybe has occurred? Not really. walking by his house, but when you've been in your house like this, maybe it's motivated you to go walk to his house,\", 'Okay,', \"So you've identified a thought that that directly connects to the behavior you want, which is on board. So onboard leads to using the drug assuming because that would alleviate the boredom?\", 'Is there an adaptive response that you can put in right there that you can interject right at that moment? When you say, board? Is there a depth of response to couplets as soon as this post detox.', \"Sounds like that's your plan. You're sitting in your house detox is done. There's no more you know, we would hope withdrawal type symptoms\", \"The thought comes upon you I'm bored. What's It's a self talk piece that could be interjected there.\", 'So to the adaptive responses, call you girlfriend.', \"On board and, and she, you know, sounds like what's voice that she's really supportive of?\", \"It seems like consequences motivates you. Right. And that's what brought you in today like to practice anyway. So I'm wondering if another adapter response response could involve, you know, I don't want any, any trouble. You know, and you can substitute a lot of words in for trouble. There's all kinds of trouble that can occur from using heroin,\", \"So getting kicked out of house, I don't want to, you know, I don't want to get kicked out my house. I'm clean. And there's something else I can do here other than drugs,\", \"Like I'm thinking in times and your girlfriend might not be around. Okay. Right. So you still want to have you want to have adaptive response. That's not necessarily tied to a person in case she isn't around.\", \"can use that one certainly, that's a good one, when she's not around. And you kind of revisit those consequences, new adaptive response. Do you think that's going to be enough motivation to keep you from going to the house?\", 'Good, good. So it sounds like you have some some adaptive responses to use. Nothing occurs to me is your parents around much', \"And night one of the times and you have gone over to your friend's house,\", \"So she could be an asset in terms of trying to stop you from leaving the house, but only when she's there.\", \"And similar to your father, you know, so it's really, I guess we kind of narrow it down to when you're home alone and particularly when your girlfriend's not available, that's your highest risk time right?\", 'So we have the cognitive adaptive responses to come employment, what was anything more behavioral, we can do like can you can you go somewhere else?', \"I think that's a good I think it's a good plan. Yeah. and remember that the more we apply these adaptive responses, right, what we hope is that you the risk decreases, like your craving decreases your motivation to stay clean increases\", \"So while it may be only convenient to drive someplace, every time no one's available, and you'd have thought that might not be something I do forever.\", \"But that'll That'll minimize the risk for now. And we want to, we want to focus on the short term first. And then we'll worry more about the midterm and long term\", 'Then circumstances may change, maybe you he reside there forever. Maybe some of his work schedule change. Maybe there are other adaptations you can make.', 'But But for now, I think this would be a good way to go. Just keeping you away from the circumstance,', \"You definitely don't want,\", 'So good news, a few behavioral pieces we have in here and then a few cognitive as well. So I want to see in a couple of days before we go into detox', 'so that we can practice some of these adaptive responses are like good practice some at home. Between now right as well.', \"and these behavioral responses as well. But we'll try to get them shored up before detox and I'll see it right after you come out as well.\", \"We'll make sure that we just keep working on applying and refining his adaptive cognitive responses and his adaptive behavioral responses. Right. Does that sound like a plan?\", \"I appreciate you coming in Jesse, and I'll see you in a couple days.\", 'Thanks.', 'Whereas the trip to?', 'how long way', \"So that's a long time for you.\", 'So when did you discover this trip was going to be', 'a little nervous? So when she made that call,', 'Alright, so so to kind of conflicting thoughts, right. So one, one is like, never go that long, six days, way too long. And the other one is that would be enjoyable. You enjoy that?', \"Yeah. So which way you're leaning right now.\", '3, 4 days?', 'So what we think is causing this worry about being gone more than two days?', \"Not to you're afraid something will happen to your, your house or,\", 'And how about when you were younger? You said this Problems found for was the same thing, the same thing. So mostly family and now some pets,', \"yes, your feelings are there fighting one another. Absolutely. And right now the feeling the thought anyway, have you know I would like to go on the trip. is winning But the fear thought was kind of dragging, dragging you down. Yeah. So what's the sensation of anxiety here?\", \"So it seems like an endless stream of worries. Yeah. Surrounding family and pets. And what might happen. So really, that's that's it, right? This is what might happen. It's the uncertainty, right? So is anything ever happened?\", \"Okay. So so far all worrying. And anxiety really hasn't paid me dividends.\", \"But you didn't in the past\", 'So something changed. What changed?', \"right? So not sure what change but used to not go, now you do go. So when you're down there, or wherever you go in the trip, you're feeling better, like you're enjoying yourself. But you're also worried at the same time.\", 'And the rest of the time.', \"alright, so the problem really isn't when you're there. The problem is now leading up to it and maybe just the first half day, your day when you're there, and maybe the last half day or two there.\", \"I suppose anticipation. So that's that's the worst part. All right, so the period between now when you leave, it's gonna be the worst part.\", \"but she'll probably stock up.\", 'And when you do go on Twitter.', \"something could happen. Certainly sure. But it Hasn't so far\", \"alright, so you'll, you'll return?\", \"Yeah, so the probabilities of it really doesn't. That doesn't alleviate the Worry, worry still there. Right. Even though you know the worry is probably going to transition to enjoyment and looking forward to that that doesn't\", \"that doesn't leave anything at all.\", 'Preparing is productive, right? Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. Well, how would the thoughts see you feel more connected to the warring?', \"So if you don't tell them goodbye enough time.\", \"Oh, it sounds like maybe if you don't say if you don't say goodbye enough times and settled that, that you'll feel guilty if something happens maybe that you regret it\", \"so that so that's the focal point of this thing's night in some way. Right?\", 'And the way you start to let go is when you tell them', 'So So what do you find yourself doing? You say goodbye and then then leave and then come back? Or', \"But you're but your thoughts are still coming thoughts are still come in and say, You should have said, goodbye one more time.\", \"that you didn't say goodbye well enough.\", \"The property was the property of saying goodbye. This you feel like you're not doing well enough.\", 'So the act of leaving itself Leave shoot guilty. And what are you guilty of?', 'So abandon', 'for a short time neglecting them for a short time.', \"And now you're in more of a caregiver role than you were then.\", 'So to be the responsible one, there needs to be guilt when you leave, I guess', \"So there's not another person driving the skill towards you. That's me. Just coming in from the side.\", \"So if I, if I leave, well, I'm responsible. And if I leave, something bad will happen. And that'll be on me.\", 'So fear of being caught as irresponsible.', \"And you could be a few left to just take you a day's travel or whatever, however far away.\", \"Right. So yeah, but that's that's still doesn't help relieve anxiety now when you come back, because\", 'Have you ever taken a trip that was like within', \"So the closer you are, it helps a little bit, it sounds like a good part of the anxiety is still there. So it really doesn't matter where you go. It's the fact that you're not home. The fact that you're not able to fully be responsible in the way that you view it.\", \"So at 20 that's a long shift. So a 20 hour shift. At what point do you become anxious when did when you start to notice those thoughts?\", \"Right So if you're busy at work, the same reality exists, meaning your pets are alone. But the way you're responding to it is different. Yeah, you're less anxious.\", \"Well, I'm buddy let's say not at work, let's say when you're on the vacations in those days in the middle when you're enjoying yourself. Is that a distraction like the more you enjoy yourself the last year\", \"But the same reality exists there alone. So really, it's your way ofwhich way of viewing things that's leading to anxiety. It's not necessarily what's actually happening.\", \"your perception of what's happening. What could happen. I guess in this case, not so much what is happening is what you worried. could could\", \"because nothing's happened yet.\", \"So, how many? Well, there's I guess there's a few different. There's a few different issues here. Right? How many vacations you take a year.\", \"sort of small proportion of the time so just looking in terms of probabilities you risk is very low because you're not quite that much. But the other issue is that even at work you're still having the same feelings and even for short trips you're still have the same feelings. So you're really limiting things xietymuch of the time\", \"it's been this way for years\", \"So you're functioning?\", \"Approved. Yeah, he's actually pretty good. working a lot sounds like\", 'Because this uncomfortable anxiety. This is painful for you.', \"going on vacation. Alright, so let's say\", \"Do you feel less anxious when you With those prevention, okay, so that helps. Right? So physically preparing your house so that your pets are safer that helps you. So what else is going through your mind so you do that right you take all the precautions you can to keep them safe and prepare your dinner for work and everything. So what's the next thought?\", \"So every time when you felt anxious and you wanted to check on them, but you couldn't leave\", 'happens then terms of thinking and feeling?', \"Well, just so it doesn't change your function, but society has their anxiety associated with\", \"Alright, so depending on what you're thinking about, that can change the level of anxiety you're experiencing.\", \"Okay, so there's that is the that is the thought you're having something like that\", 'I still have that you have that thought like,', \"So you can see the power of thinking and all this right. So the reality of your cat's health and well being hasn't changed the way you view it, as change the way you think about it. So we talked about before this idea of the adaptive response, right? So the thoughts you're having now that lead to the anxiety, we believe could lead to anxiety. They're automatic, right? They're just popping in your head. Right? It's triggered by certain things, like getting ready to leave for work and, and being at work while and look at the time and realizing something. We have the cats, right. But that's an automatic that just comes without, like, you can't necessarily stop right?\", \"Then the anxiety is right there. So the adaptive response, we also call self talk. That's, that's a thought that you can give that you can create consciously. Right? You can think to yourself, so it's not automatic. It's not an adjustment of an automatic thought. It's a thought that you can deliberately think Almost like repeating a sentence that you've memorized, you can at will choose to do that. That makes sense. So I want to make sure I draw the distinction. Some thoughts just pop in. Other thoughts you deliberately, like, when we found is if you have a thought that you deliberately think we call the adaptive response. It can counter the feelings caused by the automatic thoughts, essentially.\", \"You're just spinning your thoughts. Yeah. So, you know, and I want you to work with me to develop these adaptive responses. I want you to have most of the site all the sites you want and because I think that you can develop ones that are useful to you, but just to give an example when you haven't thought that You know, the older cat can be sick, right? And adaptive response could be or could be wide, wide variety of thoughts, but one could be it's not likely. Right? Like, you know, or if it is likely that you know, he'll probably be okay. If it's a he or she, okay? He'll probably be okay till I get home. Another adaptive response could be it would be sad and unfortunate something happened. But I have my work responsibilities and at some point I have to leave the cats alone.\", \"So you're actively responding.\", \"Well, I think that's a productive, adaptive response. I mean, you know, you're right. If you don't, if you don't earn income, then they'll have worse problems.\", \"So really good working. You're, you're being more of service to them and protecting them more so\", 'So that might be one adaptive response you may want to consider applying when you have this, this feeling of anxiety', \"So they're not striking you as anxious when you get home.\", \"She continues to survive, despite being perhaps upset with you for leaving. So that could be another adaptive response that they may be enduring a mild stressor. But sometimes they're asleep when you get home. So\", 'how bad could it be for them?', \"yeah, I mean, their level awareness clearly different than than yours. Right. So yeah, I mean, that's another good adaptive response that, you know, much higher level awareness, whereas you're not sure that Have any awareness that you're experiencing anxiety? Or maybe a little bit with a one cat who runs or think they do?\", \"absolutely. So it's understandable that you would be anxious and have concerns and but it also seems like you did make preparations to elevate their chances of having a successful experience right being okay.\", \"So you implement behaviors that are practical and that I've worked in making the house safe and keeping the plants away from them and so I think one route here if you're okay with it would be to use work as like the first point I know you have the trip. I know that's, that appears to be causing more anxiety than thinking the worst But you have more chances? Well, one way you have more chances to test out these step responses at work because it's more or less a daily thing, right? five days a week, or whatever it is. So some of those adaptive responses that we kind of worked on together, right? You could apply those. And you know, think about that the responses are not always short. Right? The automatic thoughts could be short. It can even be images, do not necessarily even complete sentences, right? Like maybe have an image of your cat in an unfortunate situation. So it's not necessarily spelled out in English, like a sentence, but adaptive responses. Well, they could be images too, but the ones I'm talking about are really sentences that you're repeating back consciously to yourself. So it's important to have them prepared and ready to go. So I often ask clients To kind of write them out and have them available. So that when that thought comes about, and it seems like you're pretty good at identifying, you know, what thoughts are triggering anxiety you would read eventually would have to read because you've memorized initially you'd read the automatic thought I mean, the upside of the adaptive response and that would counter the deal on that thought. Okay, might not the first time might not the second time but over time we believe it and I found that it changes how often and how intense to aback thoughts come in. Conscious thinking, adaptive responding, does that make sense?\", \"you've already adapted Yeah, you've already used cognitive behavioral techniques, in a way to reduce anxiety. So what we're really doing is just expanding and formalizing what you've already been doing to achieve some success.\", \"So, if you could, between now and next session, write down some of the adaptive responses that we discussed the ones you've already used and, and then work to identify the automatic thoughts at work, and then come up, work to identify them, and then consciously repeat those, those that the responses back when you have those thoughts, okay, so you're really repairing self talk, adaptive responses, with the automatic thoughts, that thought comes right? And then you have the adaptive response. And you're repeating it, you know, it's an internal, you're pitting and just thinking it unnecessarily odds out loud, although, that would surely be okay to not know, your coworkers, you know, respond something like that.\", 'Yeah. And and putting in a security type measure. You could lessen anxiety, or it could create anxiety,', \"and I don't know which, you know. So I think if you're okay with it, we'll start with the adaptive responses.\", \"See how that works out. And we have other options. Putting security systems in such to shy out in the future if necessary. Let's try the adaptive responding. Then trying to keep track of how well it works for you like, what your what your thoughts and feelings were. After you applied it,\", \"Yeah. So you know, maybe like a one to 10 with 10 being the worst, okay, and measure it when you first had that experience of it. I'm pretty sure you can measure fairly accurately, you've experienced it for a long time. You suffer with it for a long time. And then after applying the adapter response, especially after a few minutes, applying a few times, maybe shoot for ones, see what it is that and note that, again, the beginning of might not see much of a change at all. Right? So be persistent with it. Okay. Give it a chance to work and see how it does. Okay. We'll start there and we'll kind of review how you do that. And then we'll work toward the things Analyze the bigger stressor right? And we'll see what we can do in terms of planning adaptive responses for that. Okay. So a good plan. Yes.\", \"thanks for asking. I see that you have signed a release so I could talk to your mother and that she brought you in today.  What's What's going on there?\", 'your family thinks show drinking problem.', 'So they asked you to come into the agency.', 'Do you believe that you have a drinking problem?', \"You think It's okay?\", 'Come on, you mind if I ask you a few questions related to drinking,', 'So, how often do you drink now?', 'What about on the weekend?', \"How much you're drinking, let's say on the weekend\", 'All right, how about during the week?', 'Are you drinking More than you want to?', \"So, so you've tried to cut down before?\", 'Do you have cravings for alcohol?', 'So are you using exclusively alcohol or are there other drugs involved?', \"when was the last time you're impatient?\", 'four or five months ago? And at that time you use cocaine.', 'And why did you stop using cocaine?', 'You crave cocaine?', 'how about Your work are you having a trouble keeping your job or your performance your job?', 'any social problems because of the alcohol use?', 'you have some social problems. Not so much with your friends a little bit but more with your family', \"Have you found that you're engaging in any activities are physically dangerous because of alcohol?\", 'Do you find that you have any exacerbation of symptoms you have already? Like any medical or mental health problems made worse by the alcohol?', \"So did you notice the point after you started drinking when you had to increase the amount that you're trying to get the same effect?\", 'When did that happen?', 'When was the last time you noticed that when you had to drink a lot more to get the same effect.', 'How about withdraw? Do you have any symptoms of withdrawal when you stop drinking? Like physical symptoms anxiety?', 'Ok, Jackie, are you open to seeing a counselor here at the agency?', \"So you are not sure what to try it out. Yeah. I'll get you scheduled to see a counselor. I want to thank you for telling me about what's going on and for answering my questions. It's been helpful.\", 'stressed?', 'What kind of test?', \"Now, that's a job that you've been interested in for a while.\", 'so you know the material on this test pretty well?', 'But the feelings and that the physiological response to heart rate and sweating, that feelings of anxiety plus those physiological responses they got in the way of you completing it, like you were unable to complete it.', \"So you weren't you weren't feeling great about taking the test in the first place?\", 'But did you know that was coming?', 'you did ?Okay.', 'So you had some anxiety in advance?', 'or no, you did. Okay.', 'erupt in that moment, and that prevented you. What do you think is leading to this?', 'And since that this was third grade.', 'And since that bad testing experience. Have you had trouble with tests since?', \"Alright, so in third and third grade, you had a really bad testing experience. And as you move forward from there, you've never really been thrilled about taking tests\", \"But you've been able to adapt. You've been able to take them and still, like pass them.\", \"So that's, that's good, right?\", 'But this particular test, which is not for scorches for work, yeah, this one, this is more of a stumbling block for you.', 'You have any ideas as to what may what may be what may be making this test such a point of anxiety for you?', \"So it really that same feeling you've had in third grade. That's coming up with this test.\", \"And the other test you take in throughout the rest of grade school in high school they didn't, they didn't have that same value attached to them.\", 'you could, you could take them again or take the course again or?', 'so you have you maybe had more options in school?', \"Right, So it's the, it's the pressure is the pressure of you need to get through this. And you don't have the safety nets that you had in school?\", 'So this a lot of pressure.', 'So is there any time limit to this test for work?', \"There's no time.\", 'How many Is it like a, like a multiple choice?', 'Okay. And you seem like, like you said, you said the night before with your friend.', \"You're really well prepared for it.\", \"So I have a few a few thoughts about this. One is I'm wondering you know, we've talked before about cognitive therapy core beliefs. So I'm curious as to what you think about what core beliefs may be operating. For you now with this with this test, this work test\", \"something like, I am a failure or I'm bound to be a failure, I'm destined to be a failure.\", \"Okay, so  destined to be failure. So that, so that, potentially, is a core belief. Right? That's, that's operating.\", \"Okay, so it could be a core belief, but it's also seems like you're still on that thought. Like as you get ready to take that test. You're thinking I'm just destined to be a failure.\", \"And you're having what sounds like a panic response to heart racing.\", \"Are you in the room alone? You're taking the test?\", \"you are. So no one's really seeing you have this. I wouldn't want to call it a panic attack yet we haven't really gotten too far into it. But it sounds like it has some panic like features.\", \"Because it's not. It's interfering with you thinking clearly enough to get to the items. So, okay. So one thought I have is you have you ever had panic attacks in the past or anything like this?, the third grade thing?\", 'And what happens once you get worked up like once your heart rate increases and You have any other physiological symptoms would', 'hmmm', \"So one one possible strategy here is we talked about the adaptive response. Right? So, which is that thought that you say to yourself that self talk, I wonder if your doctor response couldn't be I can ride this out like you have no time to test?\", 'I mean, the panic responses only maintained for so long', \"to get some in a sense to get some minor victories under your belt by like, answering those right you know, you're closer to achieving your goal\", \"So the more items you you answer correctly, the less anxious you're gonna feel because you're closer to the end of.\", \"So that's so that's one well, that's a cognitive and behavioral strategy, right? Like you can you can wait out the panic. I mean, you're in the room alone.\", \"Yeah. Now the panic painful. Right, the you know, the panic symptoms are painful. So what you could tell yourself is, this isn't pleasant. But I can write out these symptoms because they only last so long.\", 'Exactly. Yeah, because usually mean peg symptoms can run you know, five minutes. 10 minutes, 15 minutes. But you have no time limit?', 'yeah so if you can just kind of use that time to focus on the items, as you mentioned, you could get right. And kind of, at the same time be telling yourself I can ride this out.', \"So if that's worked for you that ?\", \"So that's, that's certainly that's certainly one adaptive response to try writing. Another one could be that, although it wouldn't be great to fail, you can retake the test in a year. Right. You could try it.\", \"I mean, I know that's not what you want, but, but the alternative is kind of buying into that automatic thought we know that's not working. Right. The I'm I'm Destin, that was the word right like I'm destined to be a failure. We know that's not working for you.\", \"Yeah, you just have, you just have another years of study, right? And, of course, you wouldn't have that promotion that time and that would be an outcome, I know you don't want. But it's not the end of your career, It's not like something so drastic it's important to you and I can appreciate that. But it's not the end of your career. You're not going to be unemployed.\", \"So that's great. That's another adaptive response, which you've survived this before.\", \"So this one event, I mean, I had the the incident third grade with the unpleasant experience but this one event you don't want that this kind of fashion. While use your word, your destiny by like this was one that seemed to catch you off guard but the the panic like symptoms. And fortunately your employer is going to give you the chance to retake and try this again. And, and I met you know, so you have I imagine you could you can write out these, these symptoms. And I think you have the other adaptive response, which is I've been successful this before.\", \"Oh, it's so good, when you have to take the test?\", \"So let's schedule one more appointment right before that.\", \"And we'll, we'll make sure that you have these adaptive responses down and you're ready to go. Okay. And really will kind of focus on the positive outcome. Right. Okay, which is just taking this test taking one item at a time and fighting through some of these physical symptoms you're having, and fighting through the useful thoughts.\", \"Great. So, Michelle, I'll see you. I'll see you then and work through it. I really appreciate you coming in today.\", \"So let me so let me interrupt you for just a second here. Make sure I understand you. You're really upset about your father getting on you this past week, right? Yeah. And it's something that we could talk about today is just something that you think we could do to help the situation out?\", \"Well, one idea would be to get him to bring him in here and get him to back off, but he's not here right now. And maybe there's some things that you can do to help him calm down or back up the situation on\", \"Well, that may be but maybe there's things you could do to be a little more assertive with him to let him know how you're feeling? Or perhaps to calm the  situation down.\", 'okay, well, maybe we can put our heads together and come up with some strategies to deal with your dad a little bit better. All right. Is that suddenly? Is that something we could put down in the agenda then?', \"do I describe that then? dealing with my dad. Okay. Dealing with Dad.  Is there anything else you'd like to put on the agenda?\", 'So I put down tired and sleep. So we have dealing with dad and tired and sleep. Which thing do you want to talk about first?', \"Okay. So we don't want to forget about the homework. So we want to make sure we put that down on the agenda. And so, you want to talk about dealing with your dad, get do the homework first. Tough on my dad do definitely with your dad. Okay. So we want to make sure we allow enough time to talk about your homework is it's important. So tell me what happened this past week with your dad.\", \"Okay, good. So So today's your first visit would be today, were you okay with traffic?\", 'Did you find parking okay?', \"Okay. Okay, I just wanted to interview I know you had some concerns you called me so we're going to go over that today. What I wanted to do first of all was asked you what brings you here today to my office?\", 'What what kind of classes are you looking for what exactly?', 'Okay. Okay. All right, are you right now today, Are you using any drugs today?', 'right. What is your number one drug of choice right now? We wait okay now do you smoke with friends by yourself?', 'Okay Do you find yourself doing it at home or do you go out?', \"and do you feel that that's something that you need to help you function or is it something that you like?\", 'Do you go smoke weed with other friends or by yourself?', \"Right Okay, so I mean, do you feel that you need to function or helps you function better Or is it just something that you're just experimenting with? Or what what exactly do you\", 'guide yourself spending a lot of money on?', 'how much do you spend in a week or what your, your habit like right now?', \"That's, you know, pretty much equivalent to about maybe 10 to 10 to 15 hours a day.\", \"Okay. All right. Well, you know, you know, what we want to do is just be able to help you maybe create some some steps to help you begin to phase out in time, I wanted to pretty much identify the problem and that's the marijuana would you say? Maybe there's events in your life that trigger your use. Is there something that which I wanted to ask you? What are what's your family structure like right now?\", 'So pretty much should have been raised by your foster parents and your biological parents are not independent. Okay. Now, in your family, how many siblings and your what and what What number are you using?', 'so do you feel maybe there was added responsibility put on you or do you know that you live together?', 'Right. And so your other four siblings? Where did they go?', 'separate?', 'You were raised by your foster parents And how do you feel about that? And how does that make you feel as far as foster?', \"Okay. So they're pretty much your biological sibs. And your, your, your foster parents are pretty much the ones that Rachel those are your parents.\", 'Okay. Then also, as you were, you know, living together at home, how are you disciplined? Or who are you disciplined by who discipline?', 'So that was pretty much a consequence for your behavior equal to continental. Would you say that mom was consistent? she pretty much disciplined everybody.', 'So growing up, do you feel that discipline helped you?', 'kind of set some boundaries.', 'Does your mother know that you smoke marijuana.', \"Okay. The reason why I'm asking is because in order for us to help you, we want to be able to develop a good support system. So we want to, you know, maybe in time will include you know, your mom and let her know and you know, getting some help getting some treatment. But that was, you know, some of the questions I had for as far as you know, your family how you were raised. And now tell me a little bit about yourself when you were growing up, were you more of an introvert or an extrovert meaning, you know, without going or you\", \"that kind of explains why you know, this conversation has gone well, you pretty much open Now, right now, hopefully British Columbia, you're 20 years old. And do you have any girlfriend?\", 'And do you have How long have you known or how long have you been together ?', \"So your past relationships pretty much haven't been good\", 'Did the your partners know that you were smoking or came out?', \"Were you upfront with them or is it something they found out in there? They said, You know, I don't want\", 'So some of your choices and some of your decisions that are a consequence, bad choices, decisions,', \"okay. So what we want to do is we want to be able to identify, you know, your problem and that's, you know, the marijuana use, maybe what triggers you to go use marijuana and then maybe then begin to identify some of the emotions that are behind it. But you know, you've grown up with six siblings that you all if you go to the same school or your different schools, that becomes a little bit about your, your school history.\", \"So you're pretty close to her?\", 'Now in high school, how did that affect you being moved around seven times? What was your foster parent moving you? Did you move physically your house?', 'right Yeah. So then you had to make a whole new set of friends.', 'And that was the challenge with meeting new friends. Not knowing who You know your friends are what they do. Right? What are some of the subjects that maybe were that came easy to you that you enjoy that were you know what you did well and what some of the areas that you excelled in', \"so spelling and reading are your strong points. Yeah, that kind of explains why you're cute. You're pretty good. As far as you know, being vocal, you're okay. You'd like to talk to people, you engage well with people. So spelling English, what were some of the classes that maybe you didn't really enjoy? Or you had a challenge with\", \"Alright, so you're looking for independence in your relationship. Now, how long have you been together? About a year?\", 'And when Franklin Did you notice that? What you kind of think it was the problem like the independence, lack of independence?', \"So you're looking for that freedom. Sarah, this kind of resonate with you?\", 'Can you can you tell him that?', \"So Frank, what's it like to hear that?\", 'So, Sarah, Do you sense that and, frankly, feels guilty about that?', 'You feel rejected.', 'So you mentioned that the six months to a year has been the same for you like was the beginning of the marriage, something different to what you have that', 'So for you a couple months after that initial phase. So around the same time you started experiencing this difficulty in the marriage', 'Okay, are you okay with some space?', \"So maybe this, this idea of space isn't really something you feel will work for you.\", \"Do want to try to address Frank's concerns about the space?\", 'You seem apprehensive about it.', \"So maybe just experiment with it, try it for one night and see what happens. So, in the year and a half, you've been married, Is there ever been a night when you've gone out by yourself?\", 'Okay, and what would happened, like in terms of like between you, so,', \"all right, so this is really an experiment that's already been tried.\", \"yeah. Just Just a few times. Is there any reason to believe that if you try it next week, it'll be different?\", \"Don't you don't think so.\", 'Sir, what do you think about that?', \"All right. So in terms of the going out, although going out with your friends wouldn't have to be on the weekend that something could happen during the week.\", \"Okay, so you could agree. The both of you could agree to that as kind of terms of this behavioral experiment or weekends, you'll spend those weekends together.\", 'Because that was a concern you specifically brought up. How about Sarah, how about the times during the week? How do you feel about those?', \"You feel like you'd respond better to that? Would that be a better experience?\", 'Something that you think that you could try next week.', \"So, let's talk about when because you've gone out before and you said it was just getting out. Getting out the house that was the, the real challenge right? So walk me through. This really goes through both of you. What we through what happens when you're when you're getting ready to leave when you're planning to head out?\", 'So ultimately, after all that you you do go, but you feel feel guilty. And do you have a good time?', \"So sometimes you have a good time sometimes you don't. You're worried about Sarah being home. How about when you come home?\", 'Is that how you see it Sarah, the way Frank described it?', \"so how about one is out? Like so after after he's left? What do you What are you thinking that? Like?\", \"You're anxious something bad's gonna happen.\", \"Do you think that there's been any reason for that thinking, like, do you think there's any basis for thinking something bad's gonna happen?\", \"Alright, so you're really frustrated by not being able to go out, go out. But you're anxious about when he goes out. So we talked about the possibility of like an experiment or you go out sounds like we might run to the same difficulties you experienced before. What can we change to increase the chances of that experiment working?\", \"So, so if you called when he was at Piedmont The answer is that's something that's normally possible.\", \"So that's a compromise, you'd be willing to make. Absolutely something like that.\", 'You need any other reassurances from Frank, Sarah?', \"Do you have a plan to call Frank? Like when he's out? Or is it something that you would do if you just felt the need to or\", 'Were you calling for some specific reason?', \"Why don't you start reinsurance? Everything's going right. Okay, so that seems reasonable to you. Right? I mean, I, I guess\", \"Would that be a good compromise? It was a text or two. I guess. That's better than a phone call, right? Yeah. So not ideal, but you can see how it might decrease your anxiety a bit. Right? And maybe work toward a little bit more freedom. So that's how I can experiment you both combined to try.\", \"Alright. So it's not a perfect plan. But it's one that you know, I would hope that we could be successful with if you could, though, you're going through it, maybe track what happens, right, from your own perspective, like what you were thinking, the fact left, what you were thinking when you left, how it went, how that separation kind of was conducted. And what happened. Same thing when, while you're out how many times you texted her If you called and then what happened when he got back? Right? That's just kind of, and you can you can keep a record of those things just independently. You know, you write it down Come your experience and you write down your experience. And we'll come back next time. No matter what happens with it, we'll compare and kind of see what see what happened and how we could make adjustments to to make it work even better.\", \"I understand that you've been having some symptoms and that's what brought you into our agency. Could you tell me about that?\", 'All right, so so a lot of worry, summer at four or five or six months', \"Have you had this worry more days than you haven't had it in that last four to six months?\", 'not quite sure. Sure.', 'Do you find the worry difficult to control?', \"So I'm going to ask you some questions related to this. Let me know if you've experienced these symptoms. You You restless keyed up on edge.\", 'How about are you easily tired?', \"Yeah. All the time. Yes. You're having trouble concentrating or finding your mind go blank.\", \"Do you find that you've been irritable?\", 'Yeah.', 'Name muscle tension.', \"and tell me about how you've been sleeping.\", 'Do I drink alcohol or use any drugs?', 'Have you ever had a panic attack?', 'Okay, trauma and history,', 'any mental health disorders at all?', 'You find the symptoms', 'very distressing. Um,', 'And what areas are the distressing?', 'Yeah,', 'How about when you go out with friends have fun.', \"have gone out. Is there something specific to your home environment you think might be contributing to this because you don't have it? at school? You don't have socially\", \"They're nothing you could isolate as maybe causing the symptoms,\", \"Nothing you can't work through.\", \"Alright, so I'm going to get you in to see one of our counselors if that's okay with you. Just take a couple days for you to get in, get appointments set and pretty get in. Is that okay?\", \"Okay. I'll get that set up. And I want to thank you for answering these questions has been really helpful to me.\", \"Okay, so sounds like there's a little bit more going on that and some more worries that you wanted to talk about. So perhaps it makes sense that, that we take a few minutes and then I chat with you, and then I'll spend a few minutes with Sam. Sure. It'll be great. Okay, Sam, do you want to go in, hang out in the waiting room for bed and I'll come find you in a few minutes. Go ahead, honey. So tell me about Sam and the issues that he's having in school.\", \"a real diversion from last year real change from last year. Oh, totally like night and day. Okay, so it sounds like there's been some problems at home. So I'm going to ask you some screening questions that I asked all the parents, some of them might fit for you. And some of them may not probably take about five minutes, and we'll just go through them together. Sure, let's do it. So why don't we start with how you're doing?\", 'So is he seeing Sam at all, or?', 'So has that meant that finances have been tight or?', \"So lots of changes, lots of things going on. Yeah. And how do you feel like you're managing with all that?\", 'Emotionally, how have you been doing them and managing things are', \"So there are ever any times that you're not managing well, like you're not good at able to get out of bed or do the things that you need to do in a day.\", 'So some struggles but yeah, okay. Do you ever cope with using drugs or alcohol?', 'So then no drinking at all at home?', 'What about making sure that Sam and your little one have what they need in terms of winter coats or food or or those sorts of things?', \"So he's wearing his coat from last year. Yeah. Do you have a sense about is that hard because of finances are there other reasons\", \"Right. So Sam's not always having the things that he needs right now then.\", 'Yeah. And what about you know food or you deserve food in the fridge? Are you able to put food on the course', 'And what kinds of things does Sam have for dinner?', 'I was what would you say he does? Is he cooking? Or are you cooking or both?', 'So with all the stress in the house, has there been any times that people have kind of gotten really upset with Sam or yelled at them or said mean or hurtful things to him?', 'And what about how his discipline handled in your house? Has anybody ever spanked or hit or physically hurt Sam in any way?', \"What about sexual abuse? Has anyone touched Sam in a sexual way or an inappropriate way? Excuse me? Yeah, that's a hard question to hear for lots of people. But I asked everybody that question,\", \"So, so he's been safe from sexual abuse or from sexual appropriate touch. Okay. So how do you think Sam's doing in his close family relationships do you think Sam's feeling loved And supported.\", 'So what do you think he would say if he was here? And I asked him if he felt loved.', \"There's some doubt?\", 'You mentioned that there was some some some difficulties with your mom.', 'has there been any time that your mom has become physically aggressive in the home?', 'And what about her relationship with you? How is she managing or how are you managing together with her in the home?', 'And Has it ever come to physical blows between the two of you?', 'And when you mean arguments how intense are those arguments getting?', \"Is it ever it's never come to physical blows?\", 'And that, that that intensity, is that kind of like arguing or is it like yelling, screaming and door slamming or people throwing objects?', 'And where are Sam and the baby when these things are happening?', \"so it sounds like there's kind of a lot of tension and, and, and arguing in that relationship. How often would you say that that's happening that it comes to that kind of arguing and yelling place?\", 'Can one sort of last question what has anyone in your family been in prison or in jail?', \"Okay. So thank you very much for sharing all of that. I'm just going to recap. Sounds like there's been a lot of stressors and lots of change over the last year. Yeah. Sam status moved away, which is kind of created some changes in finances, which have led to, maybe not always having the food or the clothing that you've needed or that Sam has needed. You've got, your mom has moved in, and there's some stress and tension and arguing that's happening in that. And you've also told me that maybe all of these stressors and stuff have contributed to Sam not feeling as loved or as cared for. On the other hand, it sounds like you're managing emotionally and that you're not using any drugs or alcohol. You have told me that there are no concerns regarding physical, emotional or sexual abuse. For Sam and his life, and that nobody in your family more in Sam's life has gone to prison. So I think you're right there is likely a connection between kind of what's happening for Sam in school and the difficulties that he's starting to have with all of these stresses and changes at home. So I'm going to book a follow up appointment for you and Sam to come in. And at that time, we'll talk about some of the ways in which I might be able to help or develop a plan together.\", 'All right. So make sure you make an appointment on your way out to come back in as soon as you can. Okay.', \"Yeah. You gotta see Sam right now. And then when when I'm done, just make sure on the way that you talk to reception about making another appointment. Okay. All right. Exactly. Last All right. Okay. Thanks.\", \"So I'm not sure how much you know already about sort of what you're doing here, if it's okay, I'll give you a little rundown.\", \"So basically, we're here I'm just going to talk to you for a little bit about sort of what your goals are for your life, get to know you a little bit better and talk about some different behaviors that you might be engaging in. It's not my job at all, to judge you or to try and change you, you know, basically, I'm going to talk to you about how things are going, any changes you might want to make in your life, how I could help you with that, and just what I can do that's going to be most beneficial for you. Okay. All right. So I guess just to get started, can you tell me a little bit about yourself?\", 'And What kinds of things do you plan for your life?', \"That's great. Do you have a plan as to where you might want to go? Or?\", 'Oh,  Cool.', 'So kind of keeping your options open.', 'Great. And do you have an idea about what you might want to study? or?', \"Oh, wow. Okay, that's exciting.\", 'All right, cool. What do you like to do for fun?', 'Ahmmm', 'Like to have a good time ?', 'And you have a lot of friends or a few close people or?', \"That's a good way to be Right.\", 'All right. So it sounds like in general, your things are going pretty well for you. How are your grades right now?', \"Okay, great. Well, one thing I want to ask about is, you know, different people have sort of different values or things that are important to them. They might, you know, be really close with family or really have, you know, their friends as being something particularly important. So I'm going to show you just a few things on this sheet and if you can look them are so there's things like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self determination, and spirituality. Which of those do you think is sort of important to you?\", \"Okay. What's important to you about your family?\", 'Okay. You have brothers or sister ?', 'Okay, great. And how about friendship ?', 'Great. So being a good friend and having people who are good friends, too, is important. And then what about belonging? You mentioned that one too.', 'Yeah. Not wanting to be part of a group.', \"Okay, great. All right. Well, one of the things I want to talk about is, you know, you mentioned that you like to go out with friends and party and that sort of thing. And I'm curious when you're at the parties, do you ever have any alcohol?\", 'Okay, can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene?', \"okay, you're kind of getting pressure from other people who are drinking and it feels easier for you to hold a drink\", 'Okay. And do you think that this is most weekends? Or occasionally How often do you think that you are take alchohal', \"So one or two weekends a month, You're in a situation where there is alcohol?\", 'Okay. And what sort of situations are you in?', 'So mainly just kind of hanging out with friends.', 'Are you ever places where there are parents around or mostly just just with the kids ?', 'And what about driving?', \"Yeah. Do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had alcohol?\", \"So that's something that you sort of made a decision about.\", \"Okay, what do you know about how that's dangerous?\", \"So you're really trying to be safe and make sure that you're not putting yourself into situations.\", \"That's great. You know, it's it's tough to do sometimes. And I really commend you for being able to stick with that.\", \"So you mentioned you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two, what do you think's the most alcohol you've ever had in one day?\", 'Okay. So the absolute most', 'Okay, and what kinds of things do you like about alcohol?', 'Mm hmm.  So it just kind of makes you feel relaxed.', 'Okay. Anything else?', 'Okay. And I mean, not so good things about alcohol?', \"So you've seen a lot of other kids Yeah, had some consequences and decided that's not for you.\", 'I got it. I can understand that. Any other things that you can think of?', \"Okay, well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is underage drinking is something that's not legal, and it is something that is considered pretty risky. So I'm wondering what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life?\", \"So it's kind of something that it's just there.\", \"Okay. And I'm curious, you mentioned you know, your friends are important to you and your family's important in sort of fitting in is important to you, and how does alcohol play a role with that?\", 'Okay.  So from your family perspective, that Drinking is not something that fits very well.', \"And with friends, you feel like it's easier to to hang out with alcohol. Or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun or your friends wouldn't like you as much.\", 'Okay', 'Well, when you think about your drinking and sort of looking forward five years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life?', 'Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean?', 'Okay, so the alcohol, something that might make it harder to reach your goals?', \"So when you're sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say when you get to college ?\", 'Okay, so you sort of have a plan to cut back on your drinking eventually.', 'how might that go?', \"Yeah. So you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments?\", \"Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all important, not something you're thinking about. And 10 is the most important thing,\", 'And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three?', 'Okay. So It is something you have thought about.', 'And how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale?', \"So what number do you think you'd say?\", 'Yeah', \"Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind. It sounds like you do have sort of a vague plan to make some adjustments and you're drinking at some point.\", \"And it's moderately important to you. It's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself. And you actually feel very confident that you could be successful. With it, what sort of gold Do you think might be good to set for today?\", 'Okay. Do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely?', 'But what might be some benefits of following through with that goal?', 'Uh huh. Anything else?', \"Okay. So it's, it sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking anymore, at least at the next party and seeing how it goes.\", 'Okay. Do you think it would be alright if we met again to kind of check in on how it goes and see if working out for you.', \"All right, great. And then it sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are health benefits and having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do.\", 'Okay. Well, very good. Is there anything else that you think would be important for me to know?', \"Oh, that's a great question. So a lot of times, kids who are trying to cut back it's harder if their friends are still drinking. And one of the easiest things is trying to have more activities that don't involve alcohol. But of course, that's harder if you're not doing planning. So some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say, and there's already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends. Some of the things that I would recommend, since you're interested Are you know, carrying around Different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it. So, you know, even carrying an empty beer bottle or beer can or, you know, if people are having a mixed drink, just having the coke, say without any alcohol mixed into it. Often having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol because you already have something. It kind of prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there. Do you think any of those things might work for you?\", \"Okay. What about in terms of talking to your friends about it? Have you thought about how you might approach with them? Or is that something else you'd like some tips about about telling them about your plan to stop drinking?\", 'your friends would be pretty comfortable with that.', 'Okay, great. Any other concerns or questions? Anything else? I go?', \"Okay. So then, like I said, I'll try and see if we can meet up maybe in a few weeks and see how it's going. And then if things are going great then fantastic and if you run into any stumbling blocks and we can maybe problem solve together.\", 'Is that  Okay ?', 'All right. Thanks so much.', \"Good. That's fantastic. Well, I guess if we wind up now, and then meet again, next week. Yeah.\", 'Ohh really?', 'Yeah, I can imagine so he has been really upset by that.', \"Yes, I can see that really causes you more anxiety as well that this is happening and yeah, you feel criticized by your mom and perhaps torn a bit between your mom's view and David? Yeah, I do. You talk to him.\", \"so felicity. I'm very pleased that you didn't have a panic attack last week. Yeah. And and so are you. Yeah. And I'm hoping that the work that we did today, in looking at a couple more techniques of how you can manage the anxiety has been helpful to you.\", \"week. Good. And we've discussed your homework. Yes. So expert welding perhaps if we wrap up for today.\", 'No,', \"I can see that this is very upsetting for you. felicitated is an issue that you've raised before. So I'm wondering whether we should decide that for next week, we'll start to discuss these issues that you're having with your mom so that we can work out a plan when we've got our next session. How would that be?\", \"And I can see that that's a really big issue. So I think we definitely will put this on a number one agenda for next week. Okay. And so We'll work on a theme because this is clearly very important to you. Yeah. And I think that we're going to need a good chunk of time to be able to help you to resolve some of these issues with your mom. I can't How about during the week on? In addition to the other homework you have, you have to think about what the issues are that you would like to raise with me next week about this.\", \"It sounds like that's going to be a very important thing to do, because I can see how distressed This makes you feel. Okay, ready?\", \"Okay. So we'll meet again, same time next week. Thanks Felicity.\", 'Okay. And it was up that kept you very busy.', 'Any now that you retired, you do do any voluntary work or', 'Yeah. And Have you always been like that?', 'Do you Have a lot of social support.', 'You international? Yes, yes. Yes. And I believe that you are an Airbnb host.', 'Do you enjoy that?', \"And you said you've got grandchildren and great grandchildren. Do you think that intergenerational contact is important?\", 'Why?', 'Yes. And do you think it also benefits them to spend time with people of different different generations different ages?', 'not turning things down. Yeah.', \"What's your view on nutrition and kind of, you know, having a healthy diet?\", 'Yeah. I quite like that phiosophy How do you minimize the effects of stress? Do you have any, you know, did you have any techniques or if something stressful happens? Is there anything particular that you do?', \"I think you're in your 70s. Do you enjoy being in your 70s? What was your favorite period of you know, in life? If you can, if there's an answer to that?\", 'So do you think it makes a difference? kind of moving on from those responsibilities kind of times of life. So when you when you are looking after your children? Is that what you mean by you feel a sense of relief later?', 'I think it was either earlier this year or last year you did something quite big for a stranger.', 'This year. Yes. You donated a kidney to a stranger.', \"Wow. How did you decide to do that? We'll find out about that. And then\", \"and haven't going through the transplant the operation is quite a big thing to go through.\", 'Yeah,', \"I, I think I've asked most most things on my list that I wanted to talk about, is there anything that you think that I've missed that is worth covering in terms of the theme of living well for longer?\", \"right? To raise money for ALzheimer's without shame this tandem jump out of a player.\", 'Thank you.', \"I understand that you've come to counseling because you have a particular issue that's been bothering you recently.\", 'are you okay talking about that today.', \"So I'd like to do in the beginning, is kind of set a plan for our meeting today, okay. And we can move off that plant if we need to, but I just like to start with that, and give us some structure to what we'll be doing. So, first, and this is something I want to co create with you, right? So your input is extremely valuable to it. I don't want to just lay it out and we follow it. I want you to be an active part of putting this together. So as I throw out some ideas, let me know if it's something that makes sense to you or doesn't. Okay? I'd like to start by having you explain in depth kind of what you're going through at work. I know it's troubling you and I want to hear that story. Then you're going to look for some patterns in the way you're thinking And see if there's something that I recognized all that something I can point out, that may help you a bit. And we'll get more to that later. And then to kind of as we wrap up with towards the end, maybe start getting some ideas of things you can do between sessions between now and we'll see you next time that can help combat these symptoms make you feel better. Okay. Does that seem like a fairly straightforward agenda? Any changes or anything you'd like to make to that?\", \"We'll see. Okay. So, you know, you just kind of tell me what's going on as you feel comfortable. And don't worry about the agenda. Okay. Just know that overall, that's kind of what I'm thinking about for the structure. Okay. And then You know, as we as we wrap up, we'll set to make an appointment next time and, and like I said, we'll end up with some ideas, I hope they can help you. So let's get started with kind of, you know, your experience with all this. So tell me about your, your job.\", 'This is really stressful.', \"So you'd like some make sure I understand. You like your job? But this, this dealing you've had with this particular family. And what happened as a result of that dealing has just really thrown you for a loop.\", \"So it's really drastically changed the work experience.\", \"So there's a sense of dread, anxiety. Yeah. Do you feel doubtful?\", \"It's not not a good feeling\", \"That's good. That's good. Charles, I'm proud of you for taking the initiative. Because I know it's been difficult in the past and you've really championed the things we've talked about, and I'm really proud of you for that. One thing you didn't mention was the woodworking shop that we've talked about in the past is that has that been?\", \"Kinda Okay, well as we've talked about in the past, it's really difficult to get started on some things that we've avoided for quite some time. So, like in the past, let's brainstorm. Try to figure out how we can get some some movement in the woodworking shops. That sound good. Sure. Okay, so so one thing we've discussed in the past, Charles is extremely important is what you're thinking about as you're going into the woodworking shop. So, what are your thoughts? When you are viewing or looking at the woodworking shop? What do you think?\", \"Okay, so let's explore that. So. So what's the evidence that it's hopeless to do some work in the woodworking shop?\", \"Okay, so it sounds like you're saying then it's disorganized. And it's a mess.  So how do you feel when you think about the woodworking shop that way?\", \"Okay. So it prevents you from actually getting things done is what you're saying? Yes. Okay. Which makes sense because if I thought about it that way to Charles, it would be hard for me to initiate any kind of action because if I view it as overwhelming, then I'm probably They're not gonna do anything, which makes sense. So, so what do you think is an alternative way to view the woodworking shop? That would actually be helpful? What's another way?\", \"Okay, that's a really good start.\", 'Okay? And what would that lead to? If you get those things built? What would you have to do anything with those things?', \"So it sounds like there's a lot of benefit then to clearing out a bench and moving tools which would lead to you getting things done, especially things that would involve your grandkids so you'd be able to see them and spend time with with them, you'd feel better about going to do that. But you'd also feel better about the woodworking shop in general that basically what you're saying would Yeah, okay, sure. But as we've talked about in the past, Charles, I know that it still takes steps to get there. Right? That wouldn't change overnight. So I think one useful strategies for you and I to work on a step by step plan that would get us to the place of you being able to drive for hours to see your grandkids. So how about we talked about the first step, which sounds like would be to just move things off one bench? Does that sound right?\", 'Okay. That sounds great.', \"So let's talk about that. Then let's let's sketch out what each day would look like so that we won't won't feel overwhelmed like we did in the past. So let's talk about each day and how we would sketch out each day Does that sound good?\", \"What's been going on?\", 'in the bathroom?', \"probably didn't catch the person?\", \"So he's still out in the community, right? So how is it affecting your your daily life? Can you tell me kind of what your where you've been feeling?\", 'Okay, so anxious and aware,', 'Right', \"So you have covered a lot of ground there. So you have the you have the feeling of being like worried nervous, whether that's gonna happen to you. But you've also had to kind of change your routine or you have to change routine to feel safer.\", 'has that helped has has changed in the way you dressed or changing where you go and when you go is that help reduce the anxiety?', \"You mentioned specifically your husband has, like what's been going on here?\", 'They are', 'Have you taken any precautions because of this persistent worry.', 'I was already mentioned like with the camera specifically. I mean,', 'and that seems reasonable. Once you take reasonable precautions to try to avoid being video recorded,', 'against your will.', 'But still, you have this feeling of worry anxiety and your your schedules being interfered with?', \"skewed you'd like to cope more effectively with your feelings, reduces anxiety. So when you enter into a public bathroom and we talked about automatic thoughts before those thoughts it just kind of pop into our head and they connect to feelings. That can be unpleasant\", \"Like anxiety and worry. So when you walk into a public restroom, what's the first thing that goes through your mind?\", \"Okay, so when you walk in, you're wondering if there's a camera there.\", 'And when that automatic thought occurs, what follows that in terms of a feeling or behavior?', \"So you behaviors looking for the camera or sometimes just leaving without using a restroom. And you're You're feeling is that that anxiety worry there?\", \"we've been talking about. Okay. So, really, if we think about, we talked before about the core beliefs, intermediate beliefs, and wonder if the intermediate belief, isn't it, I'm vulnerable. Or this more specifically, maybe it's more of a core belief. More specifically, I'm vulnerable in this area, like put this guy on the loose\", \"you know, committed that crime. And then, you know, that's combining with situations that you encounter, and that's where you're getting those automatic thoughts. So that sort of makes sense.\", \"Okay. So you remember what, what in terms of kind of therapy, you'd like to apply what we call the adaptive response or self talk. So it's that thought that you interject at that moment you realize you're having an automatic thought, that's going to be to in this case, anxiety and worry and behaviors that are looking for the camera isn't maybe useful behavior, but leaving, you know, that's that that could certainly be on useful behavior. So in terms of that self talk, let's let's work to develop a self talk response so that you could tell yourself to that initial, you know, I wonder if there's a camera in this bathroom. Right? What do you think you could tell yourself that would get in between that thought and the feelings you're having?\", 'Umm hmm', \"But it's good. So you have, you have a low probability of it happening, and you're taking useful behaviors to minimize your risk even further.\", \"Right. So that's a good automatic thought, I think are good adaptive response for the next thought rather. Why don't you Why don't you try that one out? Right, the next time. You had that on that thought? Right. Try out that. You know, I think that's really, you know, that's logical. I mean, it's, it's unlikely to happen. Of course, there's a chance. Right,\", \"And we, we acknowledge that in the self talk, there's a chance that it could happen, but there's precautions you can take. That's a low chance sometimes as well, so keep that on Mac thought. We'll review it In the end,\", \"right before you leave today, we'll write these down. But that's that's one adaptive response rather that I want to write down for you. I also want to talk about like, the worst case scenario, because right now you have the anxiety worry about an event that while it's unlikely it could happen. It could happen. And I'm wondering how you think you would react? If it is the worst did happen if you if you use the restroom, and you found out through law enforcement or by finding a camera that an offender had been, you know, watching you right on recording. How would react to that?\", 'And it would make sense to feel upset. But that would be upsetting for anybody. But as you noted, that would probably be relatively temporary.', \"distress, right? Well, acute, and certainly, you wouldn't be happy about it. It shouldn't be happy about it.\", 'It would probably go away. I learned to adapt. How long have you been in the state of anxiety and worry?', 'And how many days and the average week are you affected by these feelings?', 'every day?', \"So if we can compare it right, we have a chance to be recorded, right illegally. That's a low probability event. It could happen. Probably not likely. The anxiety and worry that you're having. That's a high probability event because you're suffering from every day.\", \"So there's a, there's a point at which maybe you reach and you say, I'd rather take that route to take the risk, I'd rather deal with the potential consequences of that an unlikely event to be recorded and face that if it happens, then be in the state of anxiety, worry\", \"Now you're suffering, right? And if, if you could adaptively respond effectively, you you're still gonna have that risk of being recorded. But you know, you could survive that event if it happened late.\", \"And you're taking reasonable cautions and you know, things we talked about. So, as you think about this in a more general sense, is there a adaptive response, you could apply it to that, to that on that thought of, you know, I need to be worried about This or, you know, whatever that thought looks like sometimes the thoughts in image rights may like an image have been recorded, but whatever that kind of general series of automatic thoughts are that are that are getting you anxious or worried before you even get out of the house. What adapter response? Could you apply there?\", 'probably most are', \"That's great. That's a great adaptive Yeah. And actually, that's kind of a few adaptive responses.\", \"But that's good. And you can you can apply them and we'll, we'll kind of break them down.\", \"Like I said, before you leave today, we'll break those down. So you can, you could have written down as you go out. I think it's important, because the automatic thoughts tend to spring on us quickly. It's important to rehearse these adaptive responses. So we're ready to go.\", \"Right. And, and kind of, you know, we're being we're preparing ourselves to apply that adaptive response. And in order to be prepared you, you have to know what it is. So it's good to have it written down to kind of more or less commit to memory.\", 'Does that make sense?', \"All right. So, before we leave today, I'll take care of that. And I want you to use as adaptive responses for this week. I'll see you next week. And record what the outcome Was every time you're able to apply the response, and that includes what you felt and what you actually did.\", \"And of course, as you mentioned, any physiological reactions like your heart racing, right underneath that, so that's really that sub behavior. But note both a physiological behaviors and other behaviors.\", \"Yeah. Once you're consciously controlling, and then any feelings, okay? And we'll go through them. We'll go through each time use it one by one, they have a there are and kind of see if we need to adjust the adaptive response and see how well it's working. Okay. That's the plan.\", \"So we'll go from there. And I appreciate you coming in today.\", 'Thanks.', \"Yeah, it's hard\", \"just just just come back to me just come back to the room a little bit. Can you just look up, look up, look up at me. We'll call out I still have can check it out.\", \"good events trying to get you back back into the room with me. Okay, so just look around the Can you see me this painting that's up here? What do you say to me other paintings?\", \"I just want you to catch this for me so we can throw it back to me. Okay, this fell back to me I see that's a good good start back to me. Good Practice saving stay here and stay here in the room with me here. Yeah. And also get your character on that's it. Okay, so just just want you to just to keep in the room with me a bit and sometimes it's a bit bit stressful and overwhelming. Okay, but we're still connected. Okay, you're back there. Okay. How you feeling? Yeah,\", \"completely understand why things are really, really tough moment. And that sort of conversations with a place in town could be very stressful for you. Yeah. I get Yeah. So maybe a feeling now, where you are? Yeah. Okay, so maybe just want to keep talking. Just remember that we're connected. Okay. And you're here with me. Yeah. Yeah. So tell me a little bit more. So your mom came to, to the to the statement?\", \"And how are you feeling now after you've done it all?\", \"it was really understandable. It's completely, you know, understandable that sometimes it's difficult to talk. And sometimes you can afford back to tough times. Yeah. So we just keep talking. I would keep talking like this\", \"I'm well, thanks for asking. So you sau you doing okay, what's going on?\", 'Umm hmm', \"Tell me about some of the foods that you've been eating that have been kind of leading to this problem for you.\", \"You've had a rough week ?\", \"So, let's talk about for a second. I'd like to the kind of your relationship to this problem. How do you how do you view this problem?\", 'So the so the food is in control of this situation?', \"It's in control ?\", \"Alright. So, now I want to ask you a couple of questions about the importance and the confidence of changing clearly, you have some desire to change or we wouldn't be be here.\", \"So if you're looking at a scale of one to 10, one was, it's not important to change and 10 was extremely important change. This is just how important it is for you to curtail your eating 10 times very important to you.\", \"very important. Okay. So what if I asked the same question except this time? You're confidence. So, one is you're not confident, all you can change, but 10 you're very confident you could change.\", 'overall  yeah', \"So it's below the below the scale of one to 10 this is\", 'so you can have no confidence at all.', \"So, on one hand you'd like to, you'd like to stop the eating, It's important to but on the other hand, you don't believe you can do it.\", \"You can't do it?\", \"it can't be done. Have there been any other changes you have been able to make, say in the last few years that have been positive.\", 'So you had some small successes in terms of making changes.', \"What do you think makes the this thought I'll just refer to as the food problem so much more powerful ? So much more difficult to tackle?\", 'The food is everywhere?', 'You mentioned before that brownies were the culprit for this last week.', 'You enjoy chocolate?', \"Okay. How about other foods that could be contributing the problem? Maybe you don't enjoy as much as chocolate.\", 'Definitely any of the types of candies ?', 'Pretty much any candy?', 'So of the candy, so I want to focus just on the candies. Okay, and not to the foods just for now. The thought of like I introduced the idea of stopping eating chocolate. How would you react to that?', \"That's not gonna happen?  All right,\", \"right, But that's not gonna happen ?\", \"So you know that for sure. How about the let's, let's go, for example with the Skittles. What if I introduce the idea of stopping the consumption of Skittles?\", 'Just Just that one candy. Yeah.', \"you could. It's up to you whether or not but if I introduced that idea of stopping the consumption of Skittles, how would you react to that?\", 'Well, it represents a change in the direction that you want to move.', \"we know we know that scenario that you know, you can't really make a change right now from what you're saying. Like that's the idea of stuffing chocolate is not going over well, with you\", \"and that's fine. But the idea of stopping Skittles\", \"that doesn't seem as daunting?\", \"Would you agree still on, say the 110 scale that it's important to stop Skittles?\", 'Okay.', 'How confident are you you could not eat  ?', 'So this is a change that you think you could accomplish.', \"Even though you're not sure it'll actually contribute to solving the larger problem. We know that that's something that that's an area where you don't really see a change as as likely\", \"Well, I would hope it's something that that you would want to do. I mean, what I want is one thing, what you want is really important here. Is this something that mean your Skittles, part of the problem?\", 'small?', \"Alrigh. No pun intended, right. But it's a small part of the problem, but you'd agree it's still part of the problem.\", \"Not a huge change. But it's one that we can work on.\", \"And we want you to be able to, you know, genuinely buy into the goal. I mean, if you don't think it's important, we can talk about other areas of change.\", \"right. You think you could stop eating Skittles, but you don't think it's gonna solve the larger problem or lead to?\", \"But that's what we have to work with right now. Because the larger problem is not something you mean the way you put it is it has control.\", 'So if I introduced the idea of stopping brownies,', \"So let's let's go after the change that we can achieve in this case. You know, it's not perfect. It's not ideal, but it's what you can do. you saw the plan so suffer  so for this week so you can week for this week just Just continue eating Skittles.\", \"And let's see, let's see how we do with that change.\", 'Yeah.', 'Thanks.', \"Okay. So I'm going to read a series of questions and ask you to do some different things. And this will just take a few minutes. Okay. All right. So what is today's date?\", \"10th. What is today's year?\", 'what is the month?', 'What day is today?', 'Can you also tell me what season it is?', 'Can you also tell me the name of this clinic?', 'What floor Are we on?', 'What city are we in?', 'What County are we in?', 'Dover County?

Can we get those back?', 'Let me do that again. Okay. Ball, flag and tree.', \"All right. I want you to remember those because I'd ask you to repeat them again later on.\", 'Can you begin with the number 100 and count backwards by seven?', 'continue', \"Okay, that's good.\", 'Can you spell the word world backwards?', 'Right? I want you to name the three words that I asked you to remember a few moments ago.', \"Okay, let's take that was it Can you tell me what this is?\", 'Yeah. Can you tell me what this is?', \"I'm going to say a phrase. I'd like you to repeat it back to me exactly as I say. Okay, all right. phrase is No ifs, ands, or buts.\", 'Are you right handed or left handed?', \"I'd like you to take this piece of paper from me in your right hand. fold the paper in half and put the paper on the floor.

That doesn't?\", 'More often than not. Yeah. Do you find yourself struggling to control the anxiety?', \"Sounds like you're struggling to get under control.\", \"Tell me about how it's been affecting. You mentioned in school.\", 'Not at all?', \"It's really distressing for you. Yes, that's a school about a home\", 'So good deal with deal worrying', \"Okay, so I'll ask you a few questions about this. And some that might be related to drink or use any drugs?\", 'Do you have any medical conditions?', 'Nothing. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other mental health disorders?', 'Not ever have panic attacks , have you ever had one in the past?', 'So a lot of anxiety but no panic just just', 'Intense anxiety?', 'but but never situation where you felt you had to flee from a room or anything like that.', 'Any past trauma', 'Okay,', 'Do you sometimes feel keyed up on edge or restless?', 'restless, yes', \"Do you find yourself easily fatigued?

Your home every night for as long as the symptoms have been around.\", 'All right.', 'All right, sir.', \"I appreciate you answering these questions. For me. This has been helpful. I'm gonna get your schedule with a counselor. And they should be. I'll see you in a couple of days.\", 'Absolutely. Take care, sir.', \"doing? Well, thanks for asking. I'd like to ask you some questions about your memory. Listen carefully. I'm going to say three words. You say them back after I stop reading. Here they are milk, sensible before. Now repeat those words back to me.\", \"Now keep those words in mind. I'm going to ask you to say them again in a few minutes. Okay?\", 'What day is today?', 'what is the year', 'What is the season?', 'What is the month of the year?', 'What is the day of the week?', 'What is the date?', 'where are we now?', 'What is the state?', 'What is the county?', 'what is the city?', 'What is the name of the building?', 'What type of building is it?', 'What floor Are we on?', 'what were those three words I asked you to remember?', \"Now I'd like you to subtract seven from 100 then keep subtracting seven from each answer until I tell you to stop. What is 100 take away\", 'keep going', 'keep going', 'Keep Going', 'keep going.', 'Okay, good. What is this?', 'And what is this', \"Now I'm going to ask you to repeat what I say. Ready? It is a lovely, sunny day, but too warm. Now you say that\", \"Listen carefully, because I'm going to ask you to do something. Look at these pictures and point to the circle. Then point to the square. And then point to the triangle.\", 'Please do what this says to do. Okay.', \"You'll find a piece of paper diala for you before using that blank piece of paper, please write a sentence. I see it. Thank you.\", 'Please copy this design, you can hold on to that. Good', \"Kathleen, that's the end of the test. I want to thank you This was very helpful.\", \"It's kind of a social thing for you not like a major priority. Yeah. How much do you think you're drinking?\", \"So you're drinking maybe half the time depending on what's going on that weekend.\", \"Well, how would you describe the difference between weekends when you drink versus ones when you don't?\", \"so you you feel like you get more stuff done on weekends. When Don't drink, but maybe you don't feel like you can relax as well.\", \"You're trying to be responsible and get your stuff done. Yeah. Knowing that the drinking is gonna make it harder. Yeah. Okay. And it sounds like are you getting everything done or some stuff sort of slipping when you drink?\", 'What are the things you enjoy about the drinking?', 'Okay. So you feel liberated or kind of more confident in some ways? Yeah? Okay, are there any not so good things about drinking.', 'What kinds of things happen?', \"Like you notice in your body, how much do you think is the most you've ever drank in one time?\", \"that was out of the ordinary For you to discount, what's a more typical amount that you drink?\", \"Got it. So you're you're sort of testing and pushing it in. Yeah. And sometimes crossing that limit and having some of the consequences that you mentioned.\", 'Well, kind of along those lines Looking ahead, you know, five years from now, what do you see as a goal for yourself', \"of what do you think you'll be doing in five years,\", \"So getting a full experience is really important, too. It sounds like throughout your life, you know, you talked about wanting to make the most of your high school experience. And now you're looking at how you can enrich your life in other ways. How do you think drinking too much would fit into, you know, being able to experience life to its fullest?\", \"Okay. So just to kind of summarize what you've told me so far, you're you're drinking pretty regularly, but you are trying to limit yourself you feel like three drinks maybe is probably the maximum that you can drink before you're having some of these negative consequences. And you feel better if you limit yourself to three or less,\", \"and then kind of looking ahead. You don't want to Find yourself being someone who's drinking all the time or someone who feels out of control with their drinking that you've seen that maybe in other people's lives, and it's not appealing to at all. And and you do have some big goals for your life that you want to achieve, that drinking too much could also interfere with. So where do you think you want to go from here with with regard to your drinking?\", \"So for right now It feels like a reasonable goal for you would be to sort of limit your drinking and make sure you're, you're stopping three, for example, or maybe even limiting the number of times that you're drinking.\", 'Okay. What do you see as some benefits to that?', 'sticking to those limits?', \"Yeah, I think taking steps to limit and cut back on your drinking is a really good idea. And I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me about it and being open and honest question. You know, if you don't mind, I would like to talk to probably about this in a couple weeks or a couple months and just kind of check in how things are going. Right. All right. Sounds good.\", 'Okay. So overall today are you pursuing or do you want to further your education', \"Right. Yeah. Great. So you're looking into for year junior college,\", 'And what would be like, give me a little bit during the time that you were in school. Did you have a job heavy work?', 'You sent over to the restaurant.', 'Okay. So you would prep everything, you know, all the tensile Ready?', \"Okay. Now, when you were working, how did that make you feel when you're working?\", 'but it was the start?', 'Right. And so how did it make you feel good? Because you work for something And then the finished product was your paycheck.', 'So if you want something in life, you pretty much have to work for it work for a car or not You have to work at a young age. How old were you when you started working?', \"10 years old and then you started working and As a program for the school, so you know, you've known at a young age that it's going to take hard work,\", \"Now, what about your dream job? What would be if tomorrow you could say, I'm gonna have this person tomorrow? Or this is my profession tomorrow? What would be your dream job?\", \"Wow.  And when what was what's your reasoning behind that?\", 'Tell me more about that. What would you do in your dream job?', 'Fast in the air and being above Yeah, I think being able to see different view. So pilot Have you looked into what it would take to become a pilot.', 'What is you next dream job?', 'Police Officer, have you looked into that what it takes?', \"right maybe that's something we can discuss to help you find the cadet program close fine. We're able to give you a, you know, some goals to set to get you in the program at that. But let's look at you know, back, let's back up a little bit to the marijuana. Because you and I know being in law enforcement, you know, marijuana and being a cop, pretty much\", 'And you would have to what would you have to do?', \"So, what we want to do while you're here, you know, we want to help you here develop a treatment plan and treatment model where you can pursue some realistic goals. We want to set some goals for you. Also, what about your medical History? tell me a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been in the hospital? Has anything ever happened to a broken bone\", 'What about in your family? Is there any diseases in your family and you want to know suffer for any illnesses, ailments. Okay.

Was there anyone maybe that has gone to therapy that has been in therapy Your family and family member', \"And what we want to do, what I want to do to help you with this verse is one want to develop a treatment plan to help you with the marijuana use. We want to be able to look at your support system, you know who's in your life right now? What are your friends that you smoke marijuana with? What type of people are they? Would this be a good fit for you? But our whole goal is to start you off with small steps. `So today, you're using marijuana how many times a day. So you pretty much said you use it every day.\", 'But how many times?', 'when do you wake up and what you do?', \"so one of maybe one of the realistic goals is you're okay you know we can we can narrow down maybe the relationship see which of your friends right now today? How many of them smoke\", 'Yeah so maybe a realistic short term goal is to begin to see which friends to hang out with you know and then also your mom man either way she', 'so definitely we want to look at your whole peer relationships who your friends are We also want to look at your your time right now. So, you mentioned earlier that you were working. Are you working today?', \"Okay, so maybe that's another thing a realistic goal that we need to look at, and maybe help you pursue is it as a job? Maybe because the idle time sometimes can trigger events, you know, where you begin to want to use marijuana, and then we can identify some of the emotions that you're feeling. Let's go over that maybe briefly. Before you get before you smoke marijuana, is there a feeling that you have that says, hey, you depress, so we can look at the depression and see how we can treat that. What else? What are some of the other feelings that you see?\", 'what you think?', \"Right? There's a certain days that maybe perhaps you remember or events\", \"That's when you become angry.\", 'How you were brought up?', \"So we want to maybe will equip you with some coping skills, how to cope with those things, how to prepare you maybe for the holidays, maybe there's a way we can, you know, we can begin to look at that. During the holidays. This is these are the emotions I feel. So we identify those emotions and we'll be able to, you know, take care of that we'll be able to prepare you prior to you are you falling back into the trap of going out and using marijuana Maybe during Christmas? Do you feel the same way during Christmas?\", \"Maybe even your birthday, Father's Day, Mother's Day, these are all things that we can kind of get you ready for.

But you know what, Curtis? I'm glad you came into my office. It was great meeting you. I look forward to working with you.\", 'Is there any other questions that you may have for me? Is there anything?', \"What Well, we can do we'll set you up with a treatment plan. And then I'd like to meet at least have two contacts with you your week. We can go over that. And then maybe during one of the context, we can help you with one, help you with a job. Okay? And then identifying some of the emotions. And then maybe we can get the whole marijuana use, we can begin to kind of taper it down instead of seven, you know, everyday. Yeah, we'll begin to see how we can take with that. Okay, we're down but again, I'm glad that you came.

How's it affecting you?\", \"Okay, what do you think's happening to your food?\", 'Okay, are you actually eating much at the moment?', \"Okay, and with all this happening and this says that you don't feel very safe I've got that right. Okay, have you felt the need to know to take steps to protect yourself in any way?\", 'right. Okay. Have you felt the need to use either the knife or the baseball bat so far to take it out with you for protection?', 'Okay. Has it ever got so bad Andy that you felt the need to hurt yourself or even kill yourself as the only way out the only way of coping with it?', \"even when you say getting some pills, that'd be to take an overdose of tablets?\", \"but you've not actually done anything about that so far? right?\", 'Okay. In the past have you ever had any problems either with your temper or getting into fights being aggressive either with your housemates or anybody else?', \"And can I just check again you've not been in trouble with the police or anything like that.\", \"Okay. With all this that's going on. Is there any way at the moment Andy That you feel safe?\", 'right. Okay.  And have you seen much of your parents recently?', \"And throughout this last couple of months when you've had all these worries, have you ever worried that your parents might in some way be involved in this conspiracy?\", 'Okay. Okay. Can I just check out a couple of background things with you, Andy, your general health is that okay Generally fit and well?', \"And you're not on any regular medication from your own doctor at this stage.\", \"Okay. What about other drugs And by that I'm meaning alcohol cannabis pills, Anything else?\", 'Right. Okay. And what about drugs like cannabis?', \"I think it's important I hear about this is wouldn't be something we'd be discussing with your mom.\", 'Would that be regularly to most days?', 'And how much would you be spending on weed?', \"Okay, so you have a 10 buck lesson you have a day of weed any other drugs? I'm thinking in particular things like speed or or pills.\", 'Okay. Its on a regular basis Andy?', \"Okay, when was the last time I didn't even had any speed\", 'Okay, any other drugs at all?', \"Okay, I guess the reason I was checking I think we've picked up on is sometimes when people are having the kinds of experiences that you are they find if they take certain drugs, it could make things feel a lot worse. I just wanted to check. that hadn't been your experience.\", \"Okay, okay. Appreciate from what you're saying, You're really very worried about this MI5 conspiracy and that that's the cause of the difficulties that you're having at the moment. I just wanted to check with you Do you think it could be due to anything else? And I mean, I've obviously met other people who've had similar experiences, and sometimes they're extremely stressed, some people might be mentally unwell, and it's worth it whether any of these things might be relevant to you at the moment.\", 'Alright.', \"Okay. Sure, I think I can appreciate that. I guess what I'm wondering is whether you think there's anything that someone like me might be able to do to help you as a doctor that sometimes meeting with someone like a psychiatrist or having medication or for some people even coming into hospital for a short time might be helpful. Do you think any of those things would help you at the moment?\", \"Well, I certainly believe that you're having a really difficult time at the moment, I guess I'm not too sure about is what's causing this and I'm, I'm less sure this is due to MI5 is what I'm wondering, is it perhaps you're not as well as you might be at the moment. I mean, we've been through a lot of questions And what I'm thinking is we need to try and come up with a way of supporting you through this Someone drink cuz I know your mom is I think she's waiting in the waiting room might be a good chance now to get your mum in and then perhaps the three of us can put our heads together, have a bit of a discussion about where to go from here and try and think of getting you some some proper support. Would that be alright if I got your mum in?\", \"okay, if you want to sit there then I'll just get your mum okay.\", \"And before we go over any of that I really wanted to find out from you how things are going and what you're concerned about.\", \"Is that the first time that's happened?\", 'What do you think is going', \"let's try to figure some of this out. Okay. When you said you were throwing up blubbery, throwing up bright red blood and was it like little spots, big spots?\", 'And did did you have any other symptoms?', 'what time of day was this?', 'throughout the day, throwing up the blood', \"Look, I can understand why you're worried. All right, because throwing up Blood is scary, and waking up soaked in sweat in the middle of the night. That doesn't feel right either. Let me ask you a couple of questions that might help explain things. When did you have your last drink?\", 'okay, so that was earlier this morning. All right, what did you have?', 'so tell me how it helps you.', 'So over the course of the day, in order to study yourself in order to feel calmer. How many drinks do you end up having?', 'singles or doubles?', 'right. So is it mainly vodka', \"and you ever get that feeling in the morning that some people describe that they wake up feeling so edgy. They need a drink to calm down. Yeah. It's like the only thing that works for me. Anything that works, too. So in the past week, do you think you've been drinking more?\", \"Hasn't been daily. Oh, yeah. Right. So the longest you've gone without a drink in the last month would be how long?\", 'so for all of those things, the alcohol helps.', 'Yeah. And does it ever happen sort of by the end of the day, that you have trouble the next day remembering what happened?', 'having that. Have you tried it all to cut down on your drinking?', 'You find yourself feeling feeling guilty about the alcohol.', \"because what I understand from what you're telling me is that the drinking helps meet a certain need for you, in terms of trying to hold things together with all this stuff going on, and meets a need in terms of trying to keep you calmer. But at the same time, it's getting you into trouble. It's getting into trouble in terms of relationships, but it's also the most likely act explanation for why you've been throwing up blood isn't why the lab results that I've got are consistent with an amount of alcohol that's too much for your body to handle. Really, really, and that means, ideally, that we're going to work together to find a way to do something about it.\", 'Okay, so the grades a concern.', 'What would it mean? If they they thought you were anxious during that presentation?', \"So if they notice your anxiety, then they think you don't belong in that level\", \"If they don't recognize those symptoms, they wouldn't think that, do they?\", 'Well, how do you feel about your abilities and status in the programming room?', \"So you're a good student, you recognize that you have this one area where you don't feel like you do a great job. That's presentations. In terms of grade, you really only had one bad presentation. But grades aside, you're anxious. And you're worried your classmates are gonna pick up on them.\", \"Okay. So if they thought you were us were imposter. So if they thought you were imposter to say that that was something they actually believe because of what's been happening. What would that mean? What would it mean to your classmates that you were an imposter?\", \"You don't deserve to be there.\", \"So if they believe you're an imposter based on these physical symptoms, like anxiety and mood that means to you anyway, that that means you shouldn't be on there.\", \"What's it feel like to say that\", \"Just think this whole time you really been given faking Do you really belong there?. So I'd like to move a little bit into evaluating evidence. So in this kind of therapy, we like to look at what, you know, what we're feeling and what we're thinking, and what's we can see what's observable around us. And, you know, that becomes evidence and then we analyze it, evaluate it, okay. You're worried at some level. You're worried that you don't deserve to be where you are right now. Yeah. That you're not good enough. To be a student in this program, yeah, programming. What evidence supports that belief that you're not good enough?\", \"what's going on that day.\", 'So even if you survived the program, somehow you might be bad at your job', 'any other evidence that points toward you being imposter?', \"Right. So to be safe to say that a lot of that thought of I'm not good enough is kind of based on your feelings of anxiety.\", \"Yeah so in a way you're believing With the anxiety will lead you to believe.\", \"But in the bright light of scrutiny, there are a lot of facts to support the worst case, which is you don't deserve it. How about evidence that refutes that you're not good enough?\", \"Okay, so you've got through a rigorous process to become a student You're doing well. You mentioned before, just the one bad grade right? Okay, so if you have friends in this program, right, if one of them came to you with this, this balance of, you know, one bad grade and some anxiety, yeah, versus passing, you know, rigorous standards and doing well, otherwise, what advice would you give them?\", 'would you feel comfortable giving advice to yourself?', \"So, so let's look at the the thought and the feeling. If you had to rate the percent that you believed this thought, this belief that you are not good enough to be in the program, like right now right now, yeah, but here with me. How much of your mind believes that that's true?\", \"So right now you're really not buying the idea that you're not good enough.\", \"So now let's move to let's say right in the near the end of presentation when that anxiety is there, and the classmates that could be looking at you, it could be negatively evaluating you because you're worried about how much do you believe that thought then?\", \"Yeah. really intense. So would you think that you were a more accurate evaluator of what's true or not. Now, or when you're in that state of anxiety,\", 'So this evaluation, the percent that you believe that true, this evaluation is more accurate?', 'And how much time in any given day would you spend kind of in a mood right now, or you can evaluate accurately?', \"okay. So the, so you're able to evaluate the way you are now, the vast majority of the time, right? There's a limited amount of time when you're not when there's A lot of motions going through, right? And at those times, you're maybe a little less reliable,\", 'However, in that moment you still, those thoughts are strong, right?', \"Even though it's a small percentage, it's intense. And you kind of carry that around a little bit.\", 'So I can see why this is frustrating for you.', \"I see, do you think you're drinking too much?\", 'Right? Maybe we can just explore that a little bit more. Yeah. How much would you say you drank in a day? Now?', 'about bottle of vodka. And how long have you been drinking that much for?', 'a few years, can you make it a more specific two years? Three years? Five years?', \"Okay, so you'd say of about the last two years three. Okay. And do you drink anything else apart from vodka?\", 'Right. Okay. And would that be every day?', 'right and how much is a few?', \"Okay. And then so on a weekday I've got about you take about you have about two to four pints afterwards and then you come home and drink about a bottle of vodka. Yeah, well,\", 'when do you start drinking during the day? On an average day,', 'Right. So after breakfast, and again, when did that start?', \"Okay. And what about the weekends at the same at the weekend? And would you drink you go to the pub at lunchtime at the weekend? Would you drink more than a bottle of vodka during the day or the weekend? No. It'd be about the same. Okay, and then the rest regular time when you drink more than what you tell me.\", 'Okay, so And is it just beer and vodka? Or do you drink wine?', 'Then would you say you have to drink more to get the same effect from the from the alcohol?', \"some common effect? Do you have days where you don't drink or periods where you don't drink? When was the last time you had that?\", 'for how long did that last for', 'and it In that time did you experience any? any physical feelings at all?', 'Did you ever feel? Do you ever get those similar sorts of feelings in the morning when you wake up?', \"you do. And what happens yet when you have a drink in the morning that makes you feel better? Does, right? Yeah. If you don't have that drink in the morning, what happens\", 'and you work as a bank manager.', 'Okay. Has anyone has anyone commented apart from your wife about your drinking? Have you ever had any more serious health problems from your drinking? Have you ever seen a doctor or had sometimes people get loss of memory or Fitz Shams? Very serious shakes, they need to go into hospital.', 'And did that show anything?', 'Right?', 'Right. Okay. And how did you feel about that?', \"So I can see that it's had quite an impact at home. Yeah, well, but outside the home, how's your drinking affected jobs or anything else? My job about relationships other than your wife with family friends? Well, any other serious consequences? Yeah,\", 'Okay, thanks for coming to talk to me today.', \"Is that something that you haven't been doing?\", \"I thought that might happen. So I made this sign for you. It'll help you remember to set the alarm.\", 'How did that go?', \"Well, that's why I bought you these. We can put your dirty clothes in To the hamper. And your clean clothes, you can fold them up and put them into this bin.\", \"Well last time we talked about how you forget to take a shower, so I brought you this hygiene basket because remember if you become overwhelmed, if you keep it here by the bed, it'll remind you to take a shower and you can carry it with you.\", \"I'll put the calendar up for you and also put this picture I love up here by the bed. Well, guess what? I got you a container so you can put all your meds in. If you fill it up for each day, and keep it by your bed with a glass of water. It will remind you to take your pills\", \"Sounds good. I'll put up your calendar.\", \"So we're just going to go up the hole and to the right and then there's a room on the left. Should I go first?\", \"Come in Jasmine. This is the room. That will be Meeting in today and if you come back again, we'll be in this room again. What I want you to do first is perhaps have a look around and choose where you would like to sit. where you'd like to be. Just the big chair over there. Yeah, so when you're ready, just make your way over to the chair. And I'll close the door. And from where you're sitting now, where do you think you'd like me to be in the room?\", \"Okay. So what invite you year to look around, look around the room. Take in this new space. You've never been here before. See if there's something your eyes want to rest on or if there's anything pleasant to your eyes ever really good sticky baked around the room. Most people most time to come into new environments. We want to have a good sticky bacon. We don't and you can in here. Now imagine it's pretty tough for you to be here. Yeah. Yeah. What would help you to spend a moment here?\", \"What's it like to have that pillow against your tummy?\", \"Yeah. What's it like to have your hands holding tight? They're like that.\", 'How did you how did you get here?', \"She's still here.\", 'Is there an arrangement to pick you up?', \"Man, you're looking at the time. So what time did you arrange for mom to pick you up?\", \"In half an hour. So notice you're looking around a little bit more now. helps a bit more with that pillow doesn't it? That was a good idea for you to put the pillow there. So how long do you think you'd like to be here? If you had a choice of how long you were going to be here with me in this conversation, how long would it be?\", 'Okay, maybe, maybe', \"Feel better. Yeah. You can just call mom and tell her that the first session is shorter. Yeah. Because it's enough hearts really confronting to be here. A lot of people find it confronting to come here because of the name of the agency. The issues that we may talk about in the future. It's pretty good. confronting. So just getting used to being here is a pretty big deal. And you're doing a great job. You're doing really well. Yeah. And I'm here with you\", \"Hi, I'm PJ Daniels. Sorry, let me wash my hands.\", \"Oh, thank you. That's the next thing I was going to ask you. So Dorothy, the nurse mentioned to me that you wanted to talk about your care is but what's going on?\", \"Okay. No, I totally understand that. I mean, that is quite a scary thing to go through. And I think we do need to talk about this more, and I'm glad that you've asked it. Talk to me about this. So I had a little bit of a look through your charts. I think I understand why they did it. But did anybody explain it to you?\", \"Absolutely. And you know what? There's no right answer when it comes to deciding on things that are aggressive, like the two, we really want to know what the patient values in terms of, you know, things that are that invasive, and so absolutely will respect whatever it is that you want. But I do need to find out a little bit more about you in terms of what is your understanding of what brought you into hospital.\", 'So you pretty much showed up to emergency. And very quickly they put that tube down.', 'Did anybody ask you if you were okay with that?', \"they didn't quite pick up on that.\", \"the two you've had.\", \"Okay. And so so you have congestive heart failure, and it sounds like you've got a breathing problem. Yes. And do you know why they would have put the tube down. Do you know what they were trying to do?\", \"Right. So it sounds like you understand that. I mean, usually we only put a tube in. If that was the only thing we could do to save you. Most of the time of congestive heart failure. We'll give some medications. Have you heard of lasix? Or furosemide? No, okay. It's a medication will often give if someone is in heart failure, but if someone is really sick, and then we don't think we have time to give it that's the time we would think of a breathing tube. haven't had a chance to look through the chart, but it would suggest to me you were pretty close to dying when you came in.\", \"No, my know already what I'm hearing from you. Exactly. I'm just gonna say exactly what you've said, sounds like you've lived a good life. You've been through this a few times, you know exactly what it involves. And if I could paraphrase to you quality of life is more important than quantity at this stage. Is that correct?\", \"That's an excellent question. So first, I did want to answer your previous question, based on what we're talking about. Absolutely. I agree with you that it is your wish, and we will respect that wish that we're not going to put a breathing tube down again. And then of course, your second question, which is great, as well as how do we make sure this doesn't happen? So what I'm going to do after our conversation, and I do have a few more questions, To ask you but after conversation, I write a note documenting what we talked about that we talked about the breathing too. And your reasons for why you don't want it, which of course makes sense to me. And then what I do is I document a short form called goals of care. And I just so it's a really easy way for everyone to look at the form and in two seconds, I know exactly what you want, we will give you a copy of that to take home. But I find that's not usually enough. What we also do, what I do is I tend to when you leave hospital, dictate a note to your family doctor. And that notes actually available online for anyone who might see you in any emergency department in Alberta. And in that note will very clearly state you and I have this conversation and you really didn't want the breathing to so I reassure you, we'll do everything we can to make sure people understand you don't want that to Okay.\", 'Okay. I do want to ask you just a few other questions related to this. Go ahead. And the first question might sound a little off putting, but I sort of have to ask it anytime someone is changing the kind of therapy they want. We do have to ask, how was your mood? How are you feeling?', \"Okay, excellent. And how are you feeling overall about life before you came into hospital? Like when you're healthy as healthy as you can be? Say a few weeks ago?\", \"Okay, great. Yeah. And then other related questions, we did talk about the two that we wouldn't put it in. But again, we want to make sure we know everything that you might want or not want. Okay? So if we had to give you medications to get your breathing better, is that something you'd be willing to have?\", \"Okay. And then usually along the lines with the intubation when people don't want the intubation, we often also want to know, if a nurse were to walk into the room and find just by bad luck, you would pass away or if someone just found you at home, who had passed away. Would you ever want people pushing on your chest and giving you shocks trying to bring you back to life?\", \"No, and that'll make sense to me with no breathing.\", \"There are some other things we can do. That's not a breathing tube, but they're a little aggressive. And one is have you ever heard of bipap?\", \"It's a mass that really pushes air into you. It's a little uncomfortable, but nothing as bad as a breathing tube. Maybe hard to answer this question, because you don't know what that is. But to have any thoughts on that, if you were really sick if we were to try just a mask, and we would do it just as long as you were okay with it and comfortable at the time,\", \"Now, usually, most times with bipap? It's only about two to six hours for most patients.\", \"we had to put large IVs and lines into your wrist and stuff, and take you to the intensive care unit. Again, we wouldn't do breathing too, but this is just to watch you closely.\", 'Okay.', \"I do want to say that this is not set in stone, in the sense that if you ever change your mind, we can have the conversation again. But if we don't hear from you, this is what will go with no breathing to no registered in the heart. I just want you to know that in case anything were to change,\", 'Absolutely.', \"I don't think you will either. But it's just nice to see that you're aware of that. Okay. Um, honestly, I mean, there's some other questions. I tend to ask people when I don't know them. Well, just kind of routine stuff. Okay. And maybe we'll just quickly go through it go your medical history is the heart failure Anything else?\", \"Okay, that's okay. We can usually we have it written down. Yeah, your medications. I think I saw you're on aspirin and two jocks and I think two others. Do you happen to know or have them written down?\", 'Oh, so you are on the water pill? The furosemide. Okay,', 'And. Okay, great. Yeah. Um, any allergies?', \"Okay. And I won't ask but anything that runs in your family, given your age, they told me you're 70 Is that correct?\", \"Yes. And I do have to ask the following Questions completely unrelated to what we're talking about. That's okay. Do you smoke at all?\", 'drink any alcohol.', 'Okay. And this will be sound crazy, but I have to ask any street drugs, illegal drugs, anything like that?', 'to test any over the counter herbals In addition to these.', 'And where are you living right now.', 'Okay. And how do you feel about that? That changed six months ago.', 'So you feeling better about being in that place now? A new home', 'So I think I sort of have all the information I need to make sure that your wishes are respected. Just one last time. Anything else you want to talk about today?', \"Okay. All right. Well, it's very nice to meet you and Stone.\", \"So I don't know how much you know already about sort of my role here and why you're even here. So I thought I'd start by telling you a little bit about myself. Basically, my job is to meet with all of the students I meet with everybody about once or twice a semester, and just talk with you a little bit about how things are going different behaviors that you might be engaging in thinking about any changes you might want to make for your life. If you decide that you do it's not my job to change you. I couldn't even if I wanted to. That's not my role at all. It's really to help you think about, you know, how things are going for you and how you might like making changes or moving forward. That sound okay ?\", \"All right. So why don't we start by you telling me a little bit about yourself?\", 'Oh', 'Wow. You really are involved in music.', 'When did you start?', 'Wow.', \"Yeah, very cool. Y've always wanted to be good at music. Alright, so it sounds like you're in band and a few other musical ensembles, any other hobbies you have or things you like to do for fun.\", \"It's kind of everyday, sort of thing ?\", 'Tell me a little bit about your family.', 'Cute. What  kind of dog ?', 'Oh, nice.', 'Very funny. All right, and how are things going in school for you?', \"Okay, great. So you're doing well? What sorts of goals do you have for after college or after high school?\", 'Ohh Alright.', \"Okay. You have some pretty big dreams. It's great. It's really exciting to think about that and be looking forward to the future and those things.\", \"All right. Well, one thing I'm going to ask you about is, you know, different people have sort of different things that they really value in their life, whether it's, you know, their cultural identity or their family or their friends or job or hobbies, things like that. Here's the little sheet that goes through just some basic values that might be more or less important to certain people like belonging or sense of community. Again, cultural identity or family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self determination and spirituality. So when you think about yourself, which of these are kind of most important to you in terms of your life?\", 'Okay.', 'Okay,', 'Okay.', 'Okay, great. So sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of belonging, like you said, sort of a sense of purpose.', 'And then the respect is really sort of all encompassing, not just authority, but respecting yourself, respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you.', \"Okay, that's great. All right. Well, one of the things I want to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends, so What kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends?\", \"And when you're hanging out with friends, Is there ever alcohol involved.\", 'okay, can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene?', \"Mm hmm. And so when you go to parties, most of the time, there's alcohol there.\", \"Okay.  And how often do you think you would say you're drinking?\", \"So about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not.\", \"Can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink?\", 'so it really depends on what the activity is whether or not alcohol is there.', \"Okay? And do you notice a big difference? Or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at, say a party versus the night you're playing board games?\", \"Okay, so they're sort of pros and cons.\", 'Okay. What are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol?', 'Okay. So sort of in the too much drinking or at times, can you tell me some of the less good things are not so good things about alcohol?', \"Okay So you're trying to, like you said, not engage in really dangerous activities.\", \"You're trying to stay put you're not driving or trying to stay with people that you trust. But yeah, it sounds like there's still some some things happening.\", 'can you tell me a little bit about that?', 'Yeah. Throwing up is never fun.', 'And how often do you think that happens?', \"Uh huh. Okay, so on the one side, some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed, sort of carefree. Let loose a little bit more. On the other hand, there's a little bit more, I guess. Planning involved because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can. And then there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you that sometimes you're stuck. Your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend who drink too much. Okay, and the other not so good things about the alcohol,\", \"That kind of stuff. So you're kind of stuck being exposed to things.\", \"All right. Well, you mentioned a couple times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the dangerous aspect of the drinking. Why did you make those decisions?\", \"okay. It sounds kind of similar to your, your value of respect to so on the one hand, you the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start. If there's too much, then it sort of defeats the purpose.\", 'And then with the respect, one of the things you mentioned, is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries, not sort of cross lines. How do you think that the drinking fits in with that ?', 'Yes.', \"Okay. So you're sort of looking for that balance?\", 'How much you can drink to have some of the positive benefit, but not crossover. Okay. And what have you come up with at this point? Do you have sort of a limit that you stick to or  ?', \"And do you feel like that's working pretty well for you? Or do you sometimes exceed that limit? Or, or what do you think ?\", \"So a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time you Maybe you, like you'd like to make some adjustments to make it a little smoother. Okay, so kind of thinking along those lines, how important is it to you to make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself.\", 'Uh huh.  So kind of combined  goals.', \"Okay. So you're you have a goal. It sounds like actually cutting back on your drinking. How important is it to you to work on that goal on on a scale of one to 10 Where one is not at all important. And 10 is it's the most important thing right now.\", \"Well, why'd you say six or seven rather than like a four?\", \"Yeah, looking ahead. You can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for yourself. Okay. Well, how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to, I think on that same scale from one to 10\", 'Oh, wow. Okay, why do you say 10?', 'okay, and so you mentioned, you know, quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down. Have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that.', \"So sort of Trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol, and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking. Okay. Does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or ?\", \"Okay. So I guess we'll talk about less alcohol activities. I'm just making some notes to myself and then maybe reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved. Okay.\", \"Does that sound like something you'd like to do?\", \"Okay. Well, I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me and you know, it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself really ambitious goals and going to medical school, and You know, becoming a psychiatrist or some some other form of physician, you're really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there. And it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a lot of friends who you feel probably would be supportive even if you cut down on alcohol. And that, you know, there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body in your health, your school performance, and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of drinking too much.\", \"So yeah, you know, it really sounds to me like you have a good plan in place. And as long as you're willing and interested in meeting again, I'd be very excited to be able to talk with you about how it's going.\", \"Alright, great, so I'll plan to see you then in a few more weeks.\", 'What is it the frustation like for you?', \"So let's shift it to body where in your body you feel this type feeling?\", \"So that's a hot area, feeling around the heart. And what is there in that heart and you pay attention to that, that area in your heart? What What do you find? What sort of thing?\", 'I noticed that you have been saying it when you talked about your feelings. And I would like to suggest if you can say instead of being it, and see what happens in your body so go ahead', \"So that's what's coming up frustration, anger. So what are you doing this moment with your anger as you said to me right here to chest this moment?\", 'once you accept that anger inside you, what else do you do with that anger having accepted?', \"Use the word Hi. It's a thing that to acknowledge this is, you know, something out there, we do a lot Something very strong. So it's a safe way to put it. But if you say I feel angry,\", 'But who do you feel angry at?', 'You ex husband?', \"Sandra, having just explore some of your feelings around the situation you have, I'm going to suggest that you speak to Jeff on an empty chair. This may be a little uncomfortable. But it helped me to facilitate a process where I become an observer, and you'll be in dialoguing with a party that you are actually having to deal with. And I'll be facilitating for you the process and then pointing out some of the things that we could do to change process okay. It's been Jeff and your imagination that the massive Jeff we're here. I'll bring a chair. Okay. Welcome, Jeff. I mean I welcome Jeff. And, and there's Jeff. Imagine his face looks like how you remember him and bring him in and your fantasy. And then when you're ready to just say whatever comes to you at that moment, this moment spontaneous.\", \"Okay. Okay, so there's a kind of question you understand why this happened, etc. Right? So what next thing we'll do, you'll sit over there, and you will be Jeff and see what Jeff can answer to you as to where he is at. That maybe a little bit difficult But let's do a dialogue as if he were he's not here anyway.\", \"So we'll, we'll be having a dialogue between Jeff, imaginary Jeff, and you in the present here and now. Okay. And what is what is he saying? I know they're the hurts and frustration a but any appreciation that he still cares for these children as a father.\", 'Actually what kind of father you should be for the children?', \"You should be proactive in wanting to save them. And I wouldn't mind if you wanted to see them more than then what we have agreed is there are times when when you Want to do something spontaneous and and see then then then feel free to contact us and, and see if it's okay.\", \"Sounds like a very good idea. Good offer you Jeff, are you prepared to take that off for the kids sake? Its great go your way what's what's going on here? The contracts happening okay. Seems Parties seem to be agreeing began to agree to something important. That's the children. So children will not suffer, they will actually benefit from that agreement, if you two can really, really come to a mutual agreement to what, how we're going to take care of the children. Because the thing no matter how, in my view, no matter how people live together as a couple separate together, the contract life countries, I'm still my father to my children as a mother as much as we could only get that anger out frustration out, we can come to an agreement as to how we're going to work together and even if you don't, they don't live together. We would live for the with the kids they'd be happy. Does that make sense to you?\", \"But you hear that this happened for you. And you've done it. So is there something that the now you have that you can begin to negotiate with him, no matter how he is? Because there's now a new realization that the children need that. Father and Mother. How's that for you?\", \"you're good at that. You're very good. Who's watching you working here? You're very good at creating contracts and very clear about what you want. And it's a question of how you can the two parties can get to that agreement together. What do you think?\", \"Great, because that's, this is a rehearsal for what's going to happen.\", \"I'm doing well. Thank you for asking. I understand you've been having some symptoms that have been bothering you lately.\", 'Can you? Can you tell me about that?', 'Someone someone was robbed. near where you live.', 'How long does it take you to fall back to sleep?', 'And what are you thinking about during that time?', 'That sounds scary.', 'And you said a couple hours to stay away.', 'Yeah. So', 'yeah. So this is this is troubling for you. Have you ever gotten up and check the door?', 'So you just keep thinking about it. Does it get worse as the time goes on? Or does it get better? What happens?', 'So keep cycling through the same', 'Do you ever do anything to try to get those thoughts to go away like focusing on something else?', \"Right? So you have have a fear that somebody is going to enter break in To where you live, and you're staying up at night thinking about whether the doors been secured. That's been that's been troubling. Anything else?\", 'What do you think  happen?', \"So when you leave, you're thinking about it was a hairspray Are you thinking about whether you unplugged it or not? Or turn it off or not?\", 'And how long those thoughts go on for?', \"Alright, so remember with the door you're saying that you you struggle with those thoughts, but you don't get up and check the door. Have you ever come back and checked to see if something was left on?\", \"So you're worried anxious\", 'Yeah, afraid?', 'And how, how often does this happen? Like the cycle of thoughts?', 'So every day?', 'And how long has this been going on?', 'this specific a year', \"And in that year timeframe hasn't become any worse.\", 'Yeah. How did it start out?', 'I should as you thought about it.', \"All right, I want to ask a few other questions, try to help me figure out what's going on. Have you ever been diagnosed with any condition like a mental health condition?\", 'Have a medical condition?', 'Have you ever used alcohol or any other substances?', \"And is this been the first time in your life you've experienced these symptoms? Starting a year ago up till now?\", 'Yeah,', 'never anything like this before.', \"I'm going to get you in to see one of our counselors here.\", \"I appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been helpful for me to try to understand what's going on.\", 'Thanks', \"I'm doing well. Thanks for asking.\", 'Last week you were talking in therapy?', 'So her work slow down, or not being efficient work is affecting your work productivity.', \"you don't always get the opportunity to tell people that are important at your work about the situation.\", 'You know, you have an explanation for why that works.', \"So you're feeling stuck with this whole thing?\", \"your attempt to fix the problem hasn't really worked the way you want.\", 'sort of clear plan.', 'The options are exhausted.', 'And this is frustrating for you.', \"There's no other avenue.\", 'you thought about a letter.', 'But who would you send it to?', \"You don't view them as a potential solution.\", \"some other resource you haven't tried yet.\", \"They're discussed at this regular meeting.\", 'This could be another option for you.', 'So everyone will hear your complaint', 'and maybe react in a way to help you maybe.', 'You feel as though you found an option here?', 'your first Started with all this.', \"It feels better now as you're contemplating and another potential Avenue here.\", 'well, this might be a good place to wrap this session up.', \"Move for you. Yeah. And we'll schedule See you next week. And we can pick up from there. Sounds good. All right. Cool. Next car. Thank you.\", \"I'm doing well. Thank you for asking. I understand that. You've come here today because you've had some symptoms that have been bothering you.\", \"You've lost three jobs in the past year. Is it because of things?\", \"Alright, so you have a system you go through of unplugging. Yeah, different objects in your apartment. And you're worried that they're going to cause a problem if they're left plugged in.\", \"You're so afraid that if you leave them plugged in or overheat,\", 'and your apartment will catch on fire.', 'And you have a particular order, you go in as you unplug,', \"What happens if you're unplugging the items and you get distracted or something interrupts that\", 'Will you plug the objects back in? Are we how we do it for the items are already unplugged?', 'I should go back and plug them in?', \"What's your anxiety level? Like as you start that process?\", 'Is it?', 'How about towards the end of the process?', \"Okay, so So when it comes back, everything's unplugged. So you have to plug everything back in, unplug it.\", \"And go through the whole process again. It's just pretty distressing.\", 'Yeah. And you think that This is what led to the problems of deployment.', \"Sure your employer wasn't wasn't happy with that.\", 'And that led to those new job.', \"you're working now?\", \"wasn't a good fit. So this so these symptoms have caused you some real problems.\", 'With employment and how about with your anxiety level?', \"If we were to put on a scale like one was very little exciting. A 10 was the worst anxiety you've ever experienced. What kind of anxiety having a daily basis now?\", 'by 10. So the worst ever', 'and checking the door was checking light switches, unplugging everything. This reduces your anxiety for a while just for', 'But then it comes back?', 'Is there anything else that you do that helps to reduce the anxiety?', \"Do you know how long you've had these symptoms?\", 'So So sometime Yeah. Did they start off? Like they are now? Or are they different?', 'It was the same thing that help reduce anxiety.', \"didn't cause any trouble?\", 'Will you ever taken somewhere and diagnosed or treated?', \"And now it's now it's the worst it's ever been.\", \"Do you feel like you're able to go back to work with the symptoms? Boy they are now?\", \"Because they're so disruptive.\", 'Have you ever had any medical conditions?', 'And have you ever used or do use a types of a type of drug or alcohol.', \"And I want to thank you for coming. I'm going to get you scheduled to see one of our counselors. I appreciate you spending time with me. It's helped me to understand what you're going through.\", 'Thanks.', \"I'm doing well. Thanks for asking. I understand you've had some recent difficulties that have brought you to the agency\", 'You lost your job?', 'You failed a drug test.', \"Were you aware that this was an accident? You'd be protesting?\", 'So there have been consequences to losing your job.', 'What type of work to do?', 'So, most of those employers would require a drug screen.', 'But you think it should be illegal?', 'So you want to stop using marijuana all together?', 'All right, can you tell me about your marijuana use now? Like when was the last time used?', 'So recently and how about the coke like when did you start using that for how long?', 'Any other drugs or alcohol or anything?', \"Have you noticed over time you've been using more?\", \"So it's consuming a lot of time.\", 'you have a craving for marijuana', 'Now, have you had any social problems because your marijuana use?', 'are there other important activities that you miss out on because of your marijuana use', 'Are there any activities that you engage in that are more dangerous because your marijuana use?', 'do you have any history of mental health issues or medical issues?', 'Do you notice any anxiety or physical symptoms when you stop using my one?', 'So how motivated are you to stop using?', \"you're committed to it.\", \"I'm gonna get you to see a counselor here if that's okay with you.\", \"I appreciate you taking this time to tell me what's going on and answer my questions has been helpful.\", \"I am good, thanks for asking what's been going on?\", 'Mm hmm', 'still struggling with the Adderall?.', 'right, so, go ahead', \"It's always available ?\", \"You're having some mixed feelings about it. So I'm sensing.\", 'you think you think you want to stop?', 'You do ?', 'But at the same time it is in your life ?', \"So you find you have easier access to the Adderall when you're when you're in the house or apartment with your, with your roommate.\", \"So if you physically weren't there, like with your roommate in that apartment?\", \"So you're kind of it sounds like you're recognizing that, maybe you don't have the willpower to stop taking the drug when it's right there in front of you.\", \"So mostly so so there's still some feelings for you. You want to use it, but mostly you would like to stop ?\", \"so there's some advantages for you ?\", \"it's comfortable and it allows you To be productive. Are there any downsides to it?\", \"So it's painful ?\", \"And one of the ideas you're having was sound like potentially was moving out, moving out of the apartment, because then you wouldn't have access to the who would have access to the Adderall anymore? Or it would be hard to get ?\", \"You think you're ready for that?\", 'And that moving out you really see is what you would need to do. Because stopping while living there is too difficult.', \"Remember before you've tried to stop living there a few times right or, or last few months and with your roommate having it with your roommate being the one that gives it to you. It just appears that temptation so great for you.\", 'Well, are there any disadvantages to living with your parents?', 'Okay, so humiliation would be one.', 'So some clear disadvantages to move into Paris any advantages other than the obvious who would separate you from the  Adderall?', 'Yeah.', 'things that happened before ?', \"So there's some disadvantages to this plan, but there's some advantages. And there's a key advantage of being think of narrow.\", 'That would separate you from the drug and you could potentially move out later on.', 'When you really think about it, what comes to mind?', \"That's right. It would be.\", 'Is it tough?', \"Before it seemed like you're really more on the side of making this change than not. Clearly, there's still some things you want to consider.\", 'You always end up using the Adderall ?', 'So, so make sure I understand the situation overall. You live with your roommate, she has that role and she makes it available to, you use it?', \"You've tried to stop that behavior, but that's just not working for you.\", \"You don't want to be using it. But yet you are. Especially because the proximity, right, like cuz you're right there and she has it and it's just tougher to stop that behavior. There's another possible decision, which is moving back home, which has some disadvantages and advantages.\", \"so that there's an upside to it.\", \"That would be beyond just not using the drug which would which fit itself It'd be a big victory for you.\", \"So let's do this. It seems like that's the direction you're moving. Right?\", \"No pun intended with moving. But that's, you're you, you're thinking that might be a better way to go?\", \"So, for the next session, let's plan out that and this wouldn't necessarily be doing anything. This would just be let's plan out the steps that you'd have to put in place to move out to move back home, talking to your parents, whatever financial arrangement, have the roommate, getting all your stuff out the logistics of moving, let's just go through the steps.\", 'And try to get a firm plan together. And of course, you can always re evaluate and change your mind.', \"But all we're doing at this point, is just just planning and seeing how it would look.\", 'Exciting ?', 'So I will see you and next week ?', \"and we'll pick up where we left off and we'll, we'll start with a planning and we'll see what happens with that.\", 'Thanks.', \"I am doing Okay. So, um, how have you been doing today? How's your week been?\", 'Um, so in our last session together, we talked about your lack of confidence. Do you feel like you might be progress on that?', 'Good, good.', \"So, when you say you've been journaling, were you able to when you had a negative thought, or you know, sometimes situation, negative thought, were you writing down a negative thought?\", 'and you were able to make it a positive thought.', 'So do you remember kind of what what we discussed last time about how CBT works?', 'So would you comment review before we actually get into the session?', \"Okay. So how it goes is like a cya situation or an event happens. You have a thought, Okay. And what kind of last time it was your lack of confidence? And it could be like, I'm not good enough. But that was your your thought process last time, correct?\", 'And then so when you have a thought you have an emotion. Last time you were saying how it made you feel bad about yourself, you felt incompetent. And then your behavior issue where you lash out at others and remain. So do you feel like that you kind of understand that?', 'So I know last time I said, we talked about your lack of confidence. So for example, I know you mentioned that you also were having problems with using marijuana and depression. You had problems with depression. And you also had anger issues. And out of those, which one do you think you ought to put up to discuss today?', 'Okay. Coming over about driver issues.', 'can you telll me about the last time you lost your anger?', 'yeah, things are kind of expensive.', \"Okay, so now what I'm writing down here is kind of like what we talked about how there's no family situation, you know thought and you have an emotion. So I know like what you were just saying the event or the situation was that you got your hair done and that he was angry about that.\", 'okay okay. Now what did you in that moment when he was being mean what was now how youfelt but what was your actual thought when he was saying all that stuff?', \"Okay So when he when when he was getting mad at you and then telling you you're selfish and you felt substrate got yourself I'm selfish and then you got angry. What did you do after you get angry?\", 'Okay, okay.', 'There was physical contact there.', 'So when he when he has these, he kind of gets upset at you for certain things like this. How do you think you could change from the smacking him to having a more calm and positive response?', 'how do you think you might be able to do that?', 'Like, this is how we would do it with CBT we would change your thought. So what He gets upset with you and calls you selfish. You start to feel selfish.', 'So how could you not feel selfish? Even if you changed your thought?', \"So do you think you're selfish?\", \"So I'm hearing you say is you don't think you're selfish at all.\", \"so instead of thinking I'm selfish, what could you actually think?\", 'I deserve this?', \"I mean, who doesn't deserve something every now and then. Right?\", \"Okay, so if you were thinking I deserved that. That was your thought when he was getting angry. He thought no, I'm sorry. This How do you think that would actually Make you feel what kind of emotion would you feel at that point? I drives you so confident?\", \"So if you felt competent about your decision, because you actually changed your thought, do you think that would in turn change your behavior instead of you actually get an angry you would think there's no need for this?\", \"Right. So how do you think you'd actually behave them?\", \"Right. So maybe I'm so thinking also that you're selfish when he's getting my back. Could you do you think maybe you could say to yourself instead of me, he just doesn't understand and maybe I need to tell him that I do deserve this. And explain it to him that this makes me feel good about myself.\", \"Because, you know, you know, you're not selfish. It's just something that makes you feel good.\", 'So do you think in like in the next coming week that you could actually change your thoughtsin targeted change how you feel?', \"Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay, since we talked about your angry sheets, I know you were saying last time that you were also having problems with depression and you're also having marijuana use and either one of those would you want to discuss? Or I mean, would you like to discuss your you know, your anger issues further\", 'Okay. What do you think triggers your depression, what makes you depressed?', 'How old is your son?', 'Okay. So the interesting age', \"Okay. Okay. So the situation here is that your son doesn't want to be involved with you as much.\", \"Okay And have you know, what do you think to yourself when he doesn't want to talk to mom anymore? He doesn't want to be mom. He's out doing his own thing.\", 'So when you What is your exact thought though when when this stuff happens?', \"Yeah, that's hard. When you when you've always been needed before?\", 'I fee like what kind of motion you are feeling?', 'In turn, what did you What did you do in that situation?', \"Okay. Do you think you use the marijuana also because you're pressed?\", \"Okay. So and what are you saying for me if I'm wrong is that, you know, your son doesn't want to be involved anymore. You don't feel like you're needed. That's what you say to yourself and that makes you feel sad and lonely. And then in turn you use marijuana.\", \"So, you don't want to do you want to use marijuana?\", \"Okay, that's okay. So what what I kind of want you to do for the for the next session is kind of what we were continuing what we were doing last week, you know, how you journaled and when you have a negative thought that you changed it to a positive thought. And then in turn, you solve it like, how it could change your behavior.\", 'So do you think you could do that again?', \"Like when Tom such as when your son, you know, it's kind of goes along around you think instead of I'm not eating and stuff like am I eating more thinking, you know, he's growing up that's good appraised of you know, a son that is active and, and who is enjoying life? And then how does that make you feel if you actually thought to yourself?\", \"you know, because he's probably in a good place and active and social one good person because of you.\", 'So that would make you happy I would think. And then no. Maybe then you could, you know, have a different behavior do something different.', 'Okay. So journaling. Does that sound good?', \"So none, but there might be a few small ones that you've just never found out about. So Less than a 10th of a percent days you come in probably very small, really, really small. The probability of a statement that you're making being true, is pretty low. The seventh thought rather, I'm going to make a mistake. Probably not supported by the evidence.\", \"So, the automatic thought is not accurate and not useful. I just got a couple strikes against it. But it is the thought you're having so let's deal with it. I'm going to make a mistake. So what could you tell yourself as the first part of that adaptive response, which acknowledges that fear that's realistic, that acknowledges that fear of making a mistake\", \"Everybody makes mistakes. I could make a mistake today, but it's unlikely that that also be accurate. So everybody makes mistakes. I could make a mistake, but it's probably not gonna happen. Rather than I'm going to make a mistake. So you're going to have that automatic thought either way, likely for a while until you start to apply these adaptive responses. So this is what we're working on is your response. So everybody makes mistakes, I could make a mistake probably not going to happen. And will could be a next part, which is realistic, but also positive. That can help get you past the reaction of being late morning.\", \"Okay, so there's a few few elements in there. It's going to be okay, I need to do my The job I help people all those all those are true So applying as you know even as you say this year with me as you say, it's gonna be okay I need to my shop. What are we actually having right now?\", 'Can you see yourself being able to in the moment and I realize this is difficult but in the moment of having that on that thought and that word come in. Can you see yourself applying this self talk?', \"And you've already used self talk on your own before even knew about these?\", \"A lot of the corsage to some of the effectiveness of this is based on your ability in that moment to take a step back and follow the training. Right, just like many professionals, professionals depend on their training to help them make the correct intervention correct decision. So think of this kind of like something you've learned in the training. This is a self talk. It's pre packaged, it's ready to go. You can even have it written down. Okay? Doesn't have to be short. It can be like a paragraph, or more if you want as a matter of following the protocol. Once you have the automatic thought, it's easy to descend into worry and fear. You're just looking too quick to grab a moment in there. Apply this treatment strategy. Does that make sense? Sometimes it's likely Well, most of the time, I think you would you would be able to do this. Sometimes you probably won't as important in those moments to not get discouraged. Right. So you can have a self talk for that to write something like Dr. Crowley said it was likely that once a while I wouldn't build do this.\", 'Make sense?', \"So it's the chaos of life, right in the chaos of emotions that sometimes interfere. the more times you have success, that that seems to be tied with a better chance of improving and reduction of symptoms, but allow yourself failures. Well, it's what I would expect from anybody trying to untangle all these feelings and thoughts. There's not gonna be a perfect connection between that automatic thought and applied self talk. Okay, so be easy on yourself as soon as you can,\", \"It'd be good shape, right? so it's a little more difficult than that. But overall, this these strategies are fairly straightforward. And you can definitely learn them and you can definitely do them. I want you to have that confidence. It's, it's normal to have mistakes occur. And to not always do it as you need to as you want to, but in the end, overall, you should be able to be able to apply them and actually It'll get easier in the future to develop your self talk for different thoughts. Okay?\", \"So looking into one I'm going to make a mistake. That kind of connects to what we were talking about before it says the uncertainty, you're not sure of your own skills and you're afraid of an error that's going to be costly. So when you think that thought, I'm gonna make a mistake, so this is when you're, when you're in bed before you start your day, and you have that thought, what happens right then?\", \"So there's emotional consequences. And then the behaviors. You don't want to get out of bed.\", \"When you're staying in bed, are you under more thoughts coming up?\", 'So this is really weighing on you. And he was edified these thoughts that seem to be connected with feelings that are unpleasant, and behaviors are unpleasant, but also maybe not useful.', \"So we have a reference point for later on as we continue counseling. I'd like to scale this problem like maybe on a scale of one to 10, where 10 represents feelings that are nearly unbearable, right? And one not really a problem. How do you feel on that scale? Where do you rate yourself right now?\", \"How would you rate yourself when you're in bed before you go to work?\", 'So an eight sometimes nine, right now five, so still not feeling great. Have you had to pick an emotion of standing out above the rest in anxiety, sadness, sense of dread. What would be the worst right now?', 'So five, on a scale 10 inside is really standing out more', 'What are you gonna do if I fail?', 'Oh, what happened? Oh, God. Can you tell me a little bit more about this firefight?', \"Well from from what I'm getting here. As you were intoxicated at that point in time, and you had a conversation with this girl, which led to the firefight,\", 'Okay, so it seems like you get offended and feel offended. being referred to it.', \"Right. Yeah. All right. Well, we do have some time right now. If it's okay with you. I was wondering if we could talk a little bit about your drinking habits.\", 'Sure you what is drinking do for you?', \"Okay, so to me, it seems that drinking is your way of relaxing with your friends. It's your way to socialize and it breaks that is right, it helps you socialize and, you know, I'm I also wanted to say that it's very responsible of you to be drinking and not driving. Thank you. How has it affected your life?\", \"So for my understanding, drinking, it helps you socialize with friends, it relaxes you. It's, you know, your way of just, you know, it breaks that ice for you. On the other hand, it's causing that a lot of arguments with you and your significant other Henry. Yeah. And it's causing a lot that all those arguments are leading to a lot of stress in your relationship, this kind of stuff.\", 'This seems like a very lucky guy to have someone love him that much.', \"So what I'm getting here right now is that if you do want to quit, yeah, yeah. And it's just partly because this alcohol is divided into the arguments with Henry and his positive SSL relationship. Yeah. I know we spoke about earlier and I know you don't really like like the idea of it but what do you know about it? Like what's your one shed some light on that\", \"Well, you're a different multiple philosophy life and this share the drinking stories, and everyone just kind of helps each other through this journey of being sober together. Okay? I know you don't want to join a at this point in time 10 times but hypothetically speaking, generally consider joining it maybe later on down the road.\", 'Okay, well on a scale of one to 10 being like for sure. And one being not really sure about it at all. What would you say where you are on the scale with God any?', 'six. Yeah.', 'I love you, man. Like I said.', \"Yeah. So right now we're sitting at a six or what needs to happen. Maybe we can jump that money or nine,\", \"Now, all of these are like very understandable. I mean, it's just Of course, you want some in a meeting to be close to us. You don't have to commute so far. And yeah, we all have very busy schedules. Now the fit is very busy schedule. It definitely makes sense. And of course, the environments I mean, if you're not happy, they're just a human a learning environment. If you're not comfortable there, then it's very hard for you to you know, to be in that environment. Yeah. blotchy today, I was wondering if it's okay with you, I can give you this for sure. It's just for a median. You're really close to your location where you live, okay, and my number is also on there. Give me a call if you have any concerns. And also, I just want to thank you today for sharing me your stage of drinking. And I know it's not, you know, easy to just notice. No, it's a very sensitive subject. Yeah. So I want to thank you\", \"You're very welcome. And if it's okay with you, perhaps we can schedule another follow up meeting. I'd say about two weeks or so.\", \"I'm doing well. Thanks for asking. How things been going ?\", \"Last time we were talking. It sounds like you're still having some difficulty with the quizzes. Mm hmm. Is that still the case?\", 'Can you tell me about the process of taking the quizzes? I know we tested on a little bit before.', \"So you're looking down so you take these quizzes in class?\", 'like a paper pencil ?', 'Okay, with other students around you.', 'Alright, is the is having other students around distracting you ?', \"So it's, you're pretty sure it's the quiz itself and not some external.\", 'Okay. So it was paper and pencil you seated in the room. Rooms relatively distraction free.', \"And you're looking down at really the first item on the on the quiz and what's happening? What's happening that as you look down, you read that first item. What's happening at a thought we'll start a thought level What's happening? What are you thinking?\", \"Okay, so your thought is that you're going Gonna get, you're gonna select the wrong response, and therefore get that quiz item. Wrong.\", \"How about behavior? Like, do you notice anything physically going on? As you're thinking about that quiz item and how you're going to get you call\", 'a little tense ?', \"So it could be is that this thought of, I'm going to get this item wrong is leading to these uncomfortable feelings, the physical feelings. All right. So what happens when you answer item one, like you don't know if you have a right or wrong immediately, right because it's a paper and pencil. So you answer item one and you move on to item two. What happens then?\", \"So if you like it, because you because you thought that you got the first one wrong. That's your chances again a cycle on one wrong actually increase.\", 'Okay.', \"Have you ever had a quiz that you've taken where you were confident that you got the first item right?\", \"But eventually you're going to come to one item that your doubts about ?\", 'right.', \"There's gonna be one that's maybe a little more difficult or difficult for you. So it seems like what you're saying is that when you reach that item where you have that thought, from from that point on the next item is, is more difficult because you're having a similar thought Does that pattern continue?\", \"So explain to me what like, let's just go with the example, the first item like, because just just to keep it more simple. So you have the first item. And that didn't work out for that thought, right? The second one your thought was, I have even greater chance of missing. So what happens after you respond to that second item?\", \"That's awful. So it's an awful feeling for me.\", 'So by the time you get to item five or six ?', \"Right. So that's what's on your mind.\", 'And how are those physical symptoms? Are they the same different or new symptoms ?', 'So it really just gets mentally and physically more unpleasant for you.', \"So when you just when you're saying panic, the panics really occurring a few items in after you have the first one that you thought you've missed.\", 'And this has been happening for a while, as you described, right?', 'Well, how about your grades? How have you actually been doing on the quizzes?', 'Umm hmm.', 'About your study habits if you consider yourself effective and studying ?', \"Okay, so your study habits are good. And your quiz scores are good. But you're still having these distressing thoughts and these uncomfortable physical sensations when you take the quizzes?\", 'Is that about right?', \"So really, you don't necessarily need your performance to change. You just you just need to your thoughts and feelings and behaviors to change. Yeah. So how you how you're reacting to the quizzes maybe.\", 'And B is good.', \"So Alright, so I want to take you back to the moment when you're looking at the first slide. Let's go back to that for a second. Okay. So you're taking a quiz. And you're having those thoughts surrounding the first item, which will not mistaken the automatic thought we talked about this right with cognitive behavioral therapy. Go on Mac thought is that I'm, I'm not going to get this one right.\", 'or something to that effect ?', 'What does that mean to you?', \"Alright So with that thought means to you is that you're going to miss that item and then you're going to miss all the rest of it. So you're, you're going to fail the whole quick whole thing.\", \"So looking at that, almost, let's call that an intermediate belief, right? It's more of a rule or an expectation, right? What does that mean to you?\", \"So just keep stacking other other beliefs. So you're gonna fail the course. And we're gonna fail the final rather than then the course. So a few failed the course. What does that mean to you ?\", \"You're not going to graduate ?\", \"So we've moved from failing the quiz if we just look at the meaning, right? To fail on the final to fail on the course, and now to not graduating. So if you didn't graduate, what would that mean to you?\", 'So your chosen location to be a teacher would be not possible.', \"Right. So we go a step further and say, What would it mean to you if you couldn't be a teacher?\", \"So if you were to phrase it, and kind of think back as we to the CBT techniques and the kind of conceptualization uncovered. If you're to phrase as an if statement. What would you? What would you be if you couldn't be a teacher? what that make you?\", \"I'm a person who didn't make it. I'm a person who failed. So in a way, you're saying, I'm a failure.\", 'Right.', 'Is that close?', 'So remember, we talked before about core beliefs, and how these core beliefs drive these intermediate beliefs which combined with situations like in your case, taking quizzes to form these automatic thoughts.', \"so one of your core beliefs may be that, that you're a failure. You may believe that.\", \"Does that seem like something that you've said to yourself before or thought before?\", 'Mmm hmm', \"Not because it's challenging or difficult, but something to do with you.\", \"Right. So that's what I call like the you're personalizing ?\", \"So you're saying to yourself, at a variety of levels. I'm going to be unsuccessful? I'm going to....doe that make sense.\", \"Do you think that's what's happening?\", \"So you're  able to focus and calm.\", 'well,', \"So, somewhere, somewhere is this dis core belief? And it's possible that it has something to do with you believing that you are a failure. unsuccessful?\", \"So they wouldn't believe that you're a failure ?\", 'you may believe it ?', 'And similarly, if you had a classmate that was in the same situation, and and you know, struggled with these disturbing thoughts and feelings and behaviors during quizzes, how would you evaluate them?', \"And you evaluate that they weren't a failure.\", \"But If it was  yourself. You're being a little more harsh.\", \"Which isn't uncommon.\", \"So, there's a few levels at which I think we can go after this. What I'll call a problem, but really, it's a series of thoughts and beliefs. Okay. The first is that the comic at the ground level, and that's when you are taking the quiz. And you have that automatic thought that says, I'm going to miss this item.\", \"Yes, I'm not gonna get it right. So that's your thought, I'm not going to get it right.\", \"And these situations, I like to encourage clients to apply what's called an adaptive response or self talk. So it's a it's a noun. If you're in a quiz in a quiet classroom, it wouldn't literally be self taught.\", \"But it's a thought that you were consciously applying. So the other thought that's automatic,\", 'that just pops in your head, right.', 'This one would be one that you deliberately think', \"So what could you think to yourself that would be a counter to that automatic thought that you're having, that you're gonna get that item wrong ?\", \"Okay, so just looking at the probabilities based on your past performance, even though I'm thinking I'm going to get it wrong\", \"Chances are, I'm going to get it wrong,\", 'So you are getting most of them. Right.', 'So I like that adaptive response. Right. Do you think that makes sense for you?', \"I think you did well, there. So the next time you're taking a quiz I want you to apply that adaptiv response.\", \"that this takes work. Right. So this automatic thoughts gonna come upon you. And then before you know it, you're gonna have that feeling.\", 'physical symptoms.', 'Discuss the sweaty palms. Right. And the feeling of I think you mentioned', \"So don't let it discourage you those symptoms Come on so quickly.\", \"Right. There is an intervening thought and you've identified it. Right. So, you will have an opportunity, most likely to apply that automatic thought at some point. But the first few times it might be a little rough.\", 'I guess the nice thing about a quiz is, I mean, how many items are on these quizzes?', 'So you have a few different chances to apply the adaptive responses. Right,', \"Yeah. So you know, you'd like to get on the first time where you have that on I thought we identified on that thought, but if you don't No big deal. Right? So, you know, later on maybe it takes them two or three. And then you might remember, hey, I have this\", 'Yeah. And my hope is that as you apply this adaptive response more and more, you can reduce the probability that that automatic thoughts going to come in.', \"So that's one level that I want you to, to go after it. Does that make sense?\", \"That's how many feel like you could you could do at the other level, I guess you'd call this a deeper level, but it's all really, you know, in your brain, right? It's just this core belief.\", \"Okay. And why use the word deeper is because we think of core beliefs as more stubborn, but they don't change as easily.\", \"as automatic thoughts might. I'd like you to and this is really just more selection, reflect on the evidence or evaluate the evidence that supports and refutes this idea that you were unsuccessful that you're a failure.\", \"Right. I think cognitively, you kind of understand that you're not. Right. But another sense, you feel like you are right.\", \"So in a way cognitively you're\", \"Right. Right. There's, there's a little bit of both.\", \"you can tell me that, your family would say that's not the case. But you still\", \"There's a part of you that still feels that way. There's a part of you that still believes that cognitively. There's also a part of you that thinks through that says that's that's not accurate.\", 'So I want you to weigh the validity of that core belief.', \"Right. And actually, I think that this is helpful to write down evidence that that would support it. Right. And that's certainly something to note. But also, and this is really more important evidence that refutes it. evidence that runs counter,\", \"but record both, and we'll meet next time and we'll look at the evidence evaluated.\", \"So those two, those two steps you feel like you're comfortable with and they make sense to you.\", \"When's the next time you'll be taking a quiz?\", 'next week?', 'Okay, I know how these quizzes oftehn?', \"All right. So we'll set up a session for next week. Let's try to get towards after your next quiz.\", \"So we'll have that to talk about. I think that's the next area to make. It sounds like the next area. It'd be good to try and make progress.\", \"Seems like that's what you want to work on.\", \"So We'll go from there. So I'll set up an appointment for just to have that quiz. Tried to adapt the response and try evaluating evidence. Quickly.\", 'does that sound good ?', 'All right. I will set the appointment up and I appreciate you coming in and working through this.', \"You're doing good?\", \"so we have a part that wants to settle down, a part that wants to keep going with the career so For this to chair, what I like to do is in the chair where you're seated now, this will be the emotional self, in this case, the side that wants to pursue the career. Yeah, myself before that seems like we're more that's what I really want. Yes, you're more emotionally connected. That's what you want. That's what I want. So this will be the side of you, that has the needs and the wants, and more the emotion. Okay, so that's who you'll be in this chair. That makes sense.\", \"In the other chair, let's have the critic that's inside that internal critic. That's advocating for settling down for getting married for having kids. In a way it represents a societal pressure Did those two sides seem separate to you?\", 'You feel like you can be the emotional self here, an internal critic there?', \"So, I think you remember how this work she'll be, he'll be talking to this case the internal critic, right? So the internal critics on the side of settling down, getting married. And then when you're ready to have the critic respond, you'll switch that chair and respond to the emotional needs driven and wanting some make sense. Okay. So whenever you're ready, go ahead and speak directly to the internal critic.\", \"So you've made your statement. Are you ready to switch? Okay, good switch. So I use the internal critic.\", \"an internal critic cues in the emotional side, in this case, the career side, been selfish. And notice your posture is very linear and you're upright. I noticed you kind of put your hand down a little bit when you're talking. Try to think of the internal critics, body movements. Try to act that out a little bit. Okay.\", \"You're gonna jump at the emotional side?\", \"So that's the internal critic, they respond back to the term critic from the emotional side.\", 'okay. So the internal critic is just called a selfish and one of the things is a response.', 'Let me interrupt you. So your hands are pointing back toward the career emotional self. What can you do with your hands that really embody that you want to communicate to the internal critic? Is there anything else you want to do?', \"So continueand have used that motion there. You're, you're pushing the internal critic away. Okay.\", 'does the internal critic have something to say back?', \"So you've you've now pushed the emotional side is pushed the critical way.\", \"Alright, so internal critic is that hands down here is the internal critic. Right? It's an internal critic less angry, less assertive,\", 'So the critic is more separated now maybe a little bit but also has a different outlook.', 'So the critic has lost some of its vigor and determination.', 'to move back to the emotional?', 'So at the end of this conflict, after we split into two parts here, they have this conflict is eventually a decision is a decision to pursue a career or settle down. Do you feel you gain more clarity in that decision?', \"So that's, that's really been your decision all along. But the internal critic was harassing you this whole time?\", \"And today you're able to kind of shove that internal critic back a little. And allow that internal critic to see how strongly you feel with the decision you've made.\", 'do you feel is helpful technique?', 'So he was able to give you some clarity.', \"Right. All right. Well, let's once reflect on what's happened here, between now and the next session, okay, Bye, guys. Kind of a lot happened. And it seems like you've gained clarity for your decision. And then we'll pick up with the next session and see how things have progressed with. See if that internal critic is still harassing you or if it kind of stays back.

Are you really the cause? In the larger picture? Are you really the cause of these families being broken up?\", \"Well, you're the immediate cause kind of at the end of the whole process, but the true cause happened years or months before you got there as people made decisions that maybe weren't the best for their children for themselves. So you're really coming in, to some extent the tail end of a long series of behavioral choices\", \"Ultimately, for this family that's causing you the cycle that you're worried about. In kind of the looking at the long term lengths, do you think the children are better off? Because they're not with a family right now?\", \"So immediately, there's some pain because you have to pick up the family but the long run. Maybe there's a better result. Even with that, though, let's talk about the concern you have about making a poor decision. So this based on what you're describing, do you believe this was actually a poor decision?\", 'Yeah, it feels like it is. And it was a tough decision. But looking at it in the weight of the evidence. Maybe you can appreciate that you might have had to the same thing you if you go back in time.', \"So you really did what you had to do. Because there's still a pain component there for them. You're feeling torn. And you don't want to go through this again?\", \"But doing your job in a world where you could make a mistake, that's not as appealing.\", \"So in this particular instance, this what you're saying doesn't seem like a mistake. Let's consider a situation where you did make a mistake. That would be the worst case, right? We're just taking things to the worst case scenario. Okay. Your fear here is that in a sense, regardless of what already happened, going forward, you'd be mortified to make an error. Because this pain you're feeling right now. There's just a variable that's thrown everything into chaos for you. So looking around like where you work and and the history of your profession, what's the mistake you see people make from time to time and you'll be frightened of.\", \"And then someone's hurt.

I want you to keep in mind how you felt after the times before. Now you do tend to pull out of this. And you look back at a lot differently. But in the moment, it's hard to see that. That doesn't necessarily make this any easier. But if you can hang on to we can get through this cycle of depression. You'll probably have a different outlook. If history is any evidence.

So Sounds like a good goal. So what objectives what tasks Do you think that you could do? That would help you to feel less depressed?\", 'Have you had a plan before we have walked regularly?', 'So Walking has worked before.', \"And you notice that you're walking less since you've had a first impression. I\", \"since you're on the topic of homework, which is something you think you can do there, you mentioned that it's stressful and overwhelming.

Do you find that kind of being stressed about homework is?\", \"feel like maybe you're starting the homework late compared to when it's due.\", \"That's the feeling maybe of overwhelmed.\", \"So, yeah, you're right. It sounds like this is just an organizational thing, right. So if you if you can space it out where you kind of start your homework earlier, and do it in small bits, okay. Instead of me waiting more or less the last minute, right. That would reduce the mean likely, I would think reduce some of the stressed feelings of being overwhelmed.\", \"So one, make that your sec objective then so you have the walking, okay. And then you'll have trying to space out the homework.\", 'sound good. All right.', 'What other objectives might work?', 'that worked in the past for you.', \"So it's a good break from thinking about stressing about this you put it to homework\", \"It has kind of come in the singing parts fun for it sounds like but also there's a social component seems like\", 'You seem to kind of light up a little when you talk about singing.', 'so far. This is justmaking the time.', \"Good. All right. So we'll make that the third objective. So we have walking and kind of organizing your homework differently. And then singing and that, that socializing, it's the companies that, that singing that's great. So three objectives is good. I try to get to four. If you have one. Is there a fourth objective that you can think of something else that you've associated with not feeling depressed when\", \"Yes, she does. Okay, so this seems like a good, good objective to Yes. So you're suggesting maybe visiting her more often?\", \"So again, kind of kind of getting away from the school stressors. Just take taking a break from it for a day. Yes. And then also spend time with somebody that you enjoy spending time with. Good. Good. All right. So I want to go through each one of these. And just make sure that we're kind of meeting all the criteria for an objective, which I think we can do, but these are all specific, which is good. Do you feel these are all achievable? These are things you can do. I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Well, someone that knew done in the past, right,\", \"So now we have the specific and the achievable. I don't want to get too personal and more tricky, which is making it measurable. I like to do here. I don't want to be overly prescriptive in terms of objectives. I want you to decide. But I want to see We can quantify, in some manner, how often you'll be able to do these different things or how, you know, quite like a homer but to think about the spacing would be the quantity but, but first with the walking. So in a given week, say what's realistic for you in terms of getting out and walking? How many times?\", \"Okay. Do you have two particular days in line days for your responsibilities aren't too great. You have that opportunity?\", \"Okay. Let's go one day, one time, one time a week. Let's talk with one and then we'll see what happens.\", 'so what day of the week are you thinking?', 'Consider a window of opportunity you see on Monday.', 'Wednesday?', 'Once you have a particular time range, you like to walk a few times a day,', \"That's a good time for you. As the time you can get out of house,\", \"6:30 is kind of a good, that's a good time. Yeah. 630 good. So we'll start with that objective. The Walking Every Wednesday at 630 for every amount of time are comfortable with. So, the homework is a little trickier, right? This is about spacing it out. Okay? So the homework assignments, they're stressing you out. How much time did they take? Last few few questions. How much time do they take to complete? Generally? Like an hour? So\", 'If you had the average of', \"let's go to worst case, let's go two and a half hours just to cover code worst case will generally be the worst case.\", 'when we get three,', \"two to three hours, okay. And then how much time do you have when it's assigned to when it's due usually\", 'A couple weeks. Yeah.', \"So I was ready to do the work to ease into the last Okay, yeah, I could see how that would be stressful. what day of the week isn't usually a Sunday.\", 'So you have Tuesday, and then you have another Tuesday and the week after that, you have three hours of work. And those two weeks.', \"Yeah, will be the first day and time but kind of like when you specified Wednesday 630 that's gonna be a walking time, right right at the time, and you can start the homework because the first time\", 'How long do you foresee', \"So to get some time to decompress and round Alright, so from eight to nine on Tuesday, or Wednesday, on Wednesday, you'll get the first third of the homework. And then and then just stop. Okay, that'd be that'd be done for the night. Okay. All right. That's some big plans. How about that second hour?\", \"Thursday, so it's just one day apart.\", 'Oh, do come Thursday. Yeah. an hour. Yes. And what hour do you have in mind?', \"So but 7070 so one night, Wednesday be at nine o'clock. And then on Thursday, seven nine was two hours. Seven days. Sorry. Okay. So now just the last hour remains\", \"through Sunday. Okay. So you you want to get everything done from Tuesday to Sunday night? Yeah, the rest of that time off. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Sure that's achievable. That seems like you're, you're getting a lot in there, but you think you can do it?\", 'that sounds good. All right. What time Sunday,', 'to five to six, five to six.', \"And I'm assuming it won't run over because we kind of have to be on the high side, but if it did, I would be able to go five to seven So that's kind of like, yeah, flexible time there. Yes. So what would that feel like to get your homework done?\", \"Okay. So, and there's a potential backup plan I see in here is that if something happens on Sunday, where you need more time, and you don't want to stress, you still have that Wednesday after you walk bacon. Yeah. So that could be like your, your backup. Yes, that makes sense. Yes. Because you still have another six days to have done after that. Right. All right. So all those seem realistic and achievable.\", 'Every so many Fridays.', \"So, so this is this isn't every Friday commitment. Right, this thing?\", \"about two hours, two hours. So two hours every Friday. There's something really enjoyed though. So and it sounds like you look forward to it. Yeah. So Friday, two hours, I guess. Yes. afternoon or evening. Evening. Okay.\", \"Yeah. Good. Okay. So that was the last objective this is. This is I guess about a whole day commitment, right? Because you go to the beach, it's an hour drive, so you probably wouldn't want to go down for just a few hours. More like the whole day, would they?\", 'So how many times and say a month, like once? Once a month? Okay. So you go down on Saturday morning and come back?', \"That's something to look forward to. Yes. Is that something that would be okay, in terms of like, because on Friday night, potentially, you'd be out. Right and then Saturday.\", \"Okay, that's a good idea. So you kind of make sure you restrict how long you stay out? Yes. When you know that Saturday is coming\", \"just take a break that time. Yes. Restore. All right. So that's four separate objectives. And what I want to do since I've kind of made a lot of specific notations here, I want to take a moment just take a break, and print this up for you. Okay, we'll work on the rest of your goals next time but I want you to have this so you can get started on it right away. So before I print these up as a changes you want to make\", \"And if it doesn't work, can we tweak? Oh yeah, we can always make changes. Maybe certain things will work really well. It Certain things, we'll have to take off the list altogether, maybe substitute something else. Yeah, we can, we can make edits to it the whole time you're here. Okay, we can just make a document that changes as as needed. But if you think it's a good starting place, I'll go and print this up as it is, and give you a copy and we can resume with today's session. And then next time I see in a week, or call the rest of the treatment plan. Beside the plan, yes. Thanks, Allison.\", \"I understand you've been having some recent difficulties.\", \"There's some involvement with the place\", 'So what story are you on?', 'third floor. So you threw the stereo out the window. And', 'She called whom?', \"You feel it's blown out proportion?\", 'like this happened before?', 'how about anything were you found your anger? Strong?', 'How long ago was this with a thumb four five months ago for five months.', \"All right. So do you find that you're\", 'angry often.', 'so you find yourself upset on occasion', 'do you feel like you plan to throw the TV or just something came up in the moment', \"there's more more of a spur of the moment thing spurred\", 'hey it got their attention, the TV in broken', 'so so this has', \"your anger and some of your behaviors caused some recent trouble with the law.

Ready to work. I appreciate you answering these questions. has been helpful and I'll get you set up with the counselor.\", \"That's right. That's right. We do run into each other, a fair bit at the kindergarten. So I suppose what that brings up for me is that I'm a psychologist, and there is certain boundaries that I have to uphold with my clients. And I think that we need to talk about what we're going to do about this, that we we do see each other quite often and how we're going to manage that in terms of, you know, keeping those appropriate boundaries within therapy and outside the therapy room.\", 'So how I say this, we have a few different options. The first one is that we could decide not to engage in therapy together. Given that, you know, there could be some issues when we see each other outside of therapy. Okay, how would that option sit for you?', \"Yeah, psycho psychology services are quite limited in this area. Yeah. Okay. So you really feel that you need the help and this is the only option that you've got. So given that that's the case. How do you think we could manage this one we do run into each other outside of the therapy rooms so that we don't cross over you know, the boundaries of therapists and clients. So if I see you at the kindergarten shall we acknowledge each other and you know, keep walking or how would you like to manage it?\", \"Sure, sure. And I'm really glad that you brought that point up, because I think that, given that we will run into each other quite a bit at the kindergarten, it's fine for us to acknowledge each other, but we do need to keep the therapeutic issues that we talk here in therapy for therapy. Yeah, yeah. I'm glad that you think that it that would not be appropriate.\", \"No, no, I'm, I would definitely keep it confidential, that we're in a therapeutic relationship together. Nobody else needs to yet be aware of that. Okay.\", \"That's exactly right. So if we could just keep it at you know, those things separate then I don't think we should run into any problems in therapy. Yeah, but perhaps we could check in from time to time to see you know, whether that It's becoming a problem for\", \"Do you think that sounds okay? Yep. All right. So now that we've discussed that issue, yeah. Let's talk about why you've come in to talk to me today.\", 'How do you know that?', 'Okay. It would be good for me just to stop and ask you what, what is your ethnic and racial background?', \"So after that encounter nets, third grade, your dad goes, he's Latino. Goes to pick up your report card and to pick you up. How are you treated differently after that?\", \"And I'm sure none of it hurt at that point.\", \"Yeah. I do you think she's emotionally guarded. Um, I think she'll speak to that later in the session. You know, so it says I think there have been injuries. Some of which I'm going to guess really are related to the the race pieces that she's experienced where she has felt judged under scrutiny and it just keeps repeating herself and it's separate from competitors. Man accomplishments and so there is a guardedness and there is a sensitivity and the guardedness is her way of protecting some of her vulnerability. Okay, let's move on to\", 'A lot of information there.', \"All right. Let's start with. Can we start with your parents and tell me what you feel comfortable?

And I was wondering if you'd be interested in talking a little bit more about that today? Or perhaps if there's something else that you would rather talk about\", 'So, so you were scared. It sounds like you were scared.', 'So so a lot of things were turned upside down. And when you say it was scary, I hear you saying on some level was scary for you and your your safety but it also sounds like it was scary because all these other variables or elements were put in motion that were disruptive,', \"So a lot of people have some ideas about what you should be doing.

What other ideas do you have about what you might do? In a serious moment where you're scared\", 'For your your well being and that of your kids ?', 'Okay.', \"So, your minister, someone that you're thinking about talking to a little bit about what's going on in your relationship? What are your thoughts? What would you What would you say to your minister, what would you like to tell your minister?\", \"You feel like you've been keeping some significant information from your what would be some reasons why you would tell him these things, what might be some advantages or reasons to do that?\", \"it sounds like your pastors able to see him as a whole, complicated human being in the same ways that that you do perhaps  that there's this side of him that's scary and that you don't like and then there's this other aspect of him that you, you really do appreciate. And you feel like your pastor would likely be able to do that as well. What would be another reason to talk to your pastor, in addition to this being someone you trust, and that Paul might listen to what would be another\", \"So so. So your pastor's home actually might be a physically safe place for you all to go?\", 'Hmm', \"So you've said that a few times now that things got so out of control and crazy. Tell me tell me a little bit more about how what that was?\", 'Right. So so not only was it so scary in the heat of the moment where you feared for your life and the life of your children, but afterwards, it was scary as well, because of all the things that', \"Yeah. So so. So going to your pastors talking to your pastor, possibly seeing if his house might be a place that you could run to temporarily might be something to explore and those are advantages. Are there any disadvantages, like what would be some possible disadvantages to talking to your pastor about what's been going on in your relationship?\", 'So this could really be a trigger a significant trigger?', \"So that's a little bit of a difficult situation. Yeah. As you think about this particular part of a safety plan, on the one hand, there's potentially some real advantages and positives to speaking to your minister. And at the same time, there's this possible significant risk. When you think about, you know, the pros and the cons in this situation, what do you what do you make of that? What do you Where do you go with that?\", \"You're, you're really concerned.\", \"And a part of you is really worried about the next time. And you appreciate that there are some risks involved in some of the safety planning. And you also feel like it's a risk that you're, you're willing to take given what is at stake. And really, it sounds like you feel like your life and your children's lives maybe at stake.\", \"Would it be right with you if I offered just a suggestion or a thought something to think about in terms of kids and safety planning is something that I know other moms in a similar situation similar to yours have done and that is, sit down and have a conversation with their kids about identifying a safe person to either call or run to in the moment When things are if, if things get really crazy and out of hand, I'd be curious to hear what your thoughts are about doing that with your kids.\", 'Yeah, you so you see this perhaps as a way of kind of not pulling him out of a violence situation, but having him turn away from a violent situation as opposed to turn into it without done.', \"Yeah. And as he's becoming a man and thinking about how to protect you, you're also really concerned about protecting him and keeping him safe. And I've heard you identify a few things that you're thinking about doing or would like to do. And things that you feel like you actually do have control over. Last time we talked to you, you were very clear about the fact that you can't control Paul, when he's in his fear and his rage and being violent. And what I've heard you very clearly say that you want is to figure out what you can control. You can't control him, but there are some things you have control over and specifically for you that is maybe talking to possibly a safe person, your minister.\", 'And having that conversation to see if that might be a safe person in place to go to and, and then the other pieces may be having a conversation with your oldest child, at least about who to call in the moment.', \"And I confident Vanessa that you will be able to put a plan together that will work for you and your family and I'm here to support you in any, any way that I can. And if it's at all helpful, I'd be happy to follow up with you in a few days and see if you feel the need to talk about it some more.\", 'Thanks for your time.', \"Yeah. So he, he actually see me because you went to him for increased stress. And he's concerned that your alcohol consumption may be a part of that increase And prior to prescribing anything, you want to make sure that you at least had someone to talk to that\", 'Okay. So you filled in one of the Pink Sheets and I take a look at that.', 'Okay, thank you. So, you say here that you have four or more drinks in one week, you mentioned that you may be increasing that a little bit as well. And that you have one or two drinks in one setting', \"And maybe monthly you have more than that. What what's what kind of drinks do you have? What do you do when you typically drink\", \"So it's time to increase your strength a little more. Well, based on what you put here, you get it gives you six points on this scale scale ranging from zero to 46 points will put you in what we would consider an at risk zone. So if it's okay with you to talk a little bit about that,\", \"okay. So that was sunset run zero to 40. It's not a sort of super high risk, but it certainly could be a risk for maybe increasing stress might be some physical ailments related to alcohol as well could could start to show up if you were to increase your drinking from there, or even stay there. This is a typical standard drink size over here, I'm not sure whether that fits your description of a glass of wine or not,\", \"maybe the little space it's upset, perhaps a drink drink and a half each one. So that also increased a little bit more. So perhaps maybe drinking more than you indicated on here. And for women, healthy woman your age, no more than three drinks in one setting is considered to be low or no risk and one seven in one week, seven total in total a week and what you say here is that even on this sheet, you're perhaps already drinking more than that. So what do you make of all that?\", \"Yeah, it seems seems a little less than perhaps you've been drinking or what you consider to be healthy drinking. And certainly there's there's conflicting information out there about what's healthy and what's not healthy. Imagine the increased stress work because we're concerned doctor seal as your stress increases, and if you were to describe you anything, maybe some interaction between the two, that would also be a concern for him. I would, I would think, so if you would, what is it that you like about alcohol?\", \"See, like the taste of it. And it does help to lower the stress, even if it's just for the fun of me drinking. What's not so good things about alcohol for you.\", \"your financial stress may be increased by the fact that you're drinking.\", \"the drink introduce stress and increasing stress at the same time. So on the one hand, it low is it on the other hand, it's increasing kind of the seesaw teeter totter effect. What do you make of that, given that on one hand, it lowers on the other hand, it increases and and now it's increasing even more?\", 'Imagine investment thoughts so that what have you thought of trying?', \"And he may be able to I'm not saying that he cannot just imagine that he's concerned that if you continue to drink, the level that you are drinking, that whatever he prescribes you, there may be an interaction with it to mention that he's concerned. I'm not completely sure. So you've had some success in the past of changing behaviors. And if you were to decide to make any changes here that sounds like you could draw upon that to make those changes. How important would it be for you on a scale of zero to 10? I have a low visual hero that if zero is not important, ten is very important to do something about your drinking wine.\", \"It's it's pretty up there. What do you choose a seven out of five or four?\", \"there's a lot riding on your decision on what to do with this. What if anything would bring up to an eight or nine on that scale?\", 'so so you you choose to lower your stress rather than increase it. And if lowering your drinking would have that effect that something be willing to do.', 'How confident are you that you could do something about your drinking?', \"Okay, so it's pretty high up there again, and what if, what if anything, would you choose to do would it be to cut down would it be to quit? I'm just curious about that\", \"So you'd be willing to stop altogether. That's what was indicated by the physician. Okay. So based on that, how ready are you to do anything right now, whether it's to cut back whether it's to quit?\", \"Okay, so that's, that's pretty hot there as well. It sounds as though you're pretty motivated to do something about this right now, given any responsibilities given your children learning at this point. And just on lowering anxiety, in general, it sounds and that's one of your goals as well. Well, I'm pretty confident Once you decide to do whatever it is you decide to do, you'll be able to follow through with it. Based on your experience in the past of making behavior changes. I mentioned some things that you can draw upon. What's one thing that you could do? Imagine you thought of some things might help to lower your stress.\", 'one of the things we can offer here is for you to come in and talk to one of our behavioral health specialists may be able to help you talk talk through this this area of your life, this area of increased stress and sound like responsibility there and we can make an appointment for you for like before you leave today to talk to somebody', \"that also has some information here if you're interested, some pamphlet on alcohol and and how what helps limits on how it may be affected by medications that you take as well. And I wish you lots of luck. It sounds as though you're really committed to making this shift in this change. And I imagine doctors still want to follow up with you and see how you do with your with your change within a few weeks.\", 'Again, I look forward to speaking to you in the future.', \"Good. Thanks for asking. I understand you've come here today to the agency because you had a recent arrest.\", \"alcohol and marijuana. How recently was this DUI? About a week ago? Okay, so what's been going on when that happened?\", 'get out of it. You mean get out of the charge?', 'So you feel like you can get out of the rehab or two.', \"So at this recent arrest, you realize it may be a value to stop using which really don't want to Yeah, stuck there.\", 'when you drink Do you ever socialize the same time?', 'alone so do the marijuana', \"so it doesn't sound like you're really worried about losing your social support if you stop using now early sweetie losing\", 'Any other reasons um', 'forget about problems Yeah. So affects your mood in a positive way.', 'Have you use since you had to do it?', 'So you have the use it takes away pain for you to take swings xiety feels good. But then you have these consequences of the law. And you figure those two things out.', 'You can imagine that. So it was a good the other side. Can you imagine having further it says law enforcement like more charges in the future.', \"So you could kind of picture an outcome where you beat these charges or there's not a really heavy consequence. And you'll be more careful in the future.\", 'So with that thinking, you continue to use as you were, that you would take out the part that got you in trouble.', 'First you have to get out of trouble this time.', 'So if you could have the pain and anxiety go away without the alcohol marijuana, would you continue to use it?', \"So there's a social component here.\", \"So even if you had no anxiety, no pain You'd have to give up at least those interactions with your friends. How would they respond if you went out with them? I didn't drink.\", \"So it'd be socially awkward. straining the relationships with your friends. So the quitting alcohol and marijuana like stopping use that doesn't seem like a good route for you\", 'But then you have this distressing situation which is making you second guessed some of it.', 'you need to make some change. Yeah, but not the alcohol. Drugs.', 'Something else could change.', 'So you could reduce your usage, avoid driving and that might that might get you to your goal. Would that be enough usage to stop the anxiety of the pain?', \"So that strategy might not work. That's something you've been tossing around though, this idea of isolating a little bit more, and drinking a little less. Seems like all your options here kind of grim. Yeah, that's just that's just me doesn't seem that way to you too.\", 'talking through it, yeah.', \"have any choice? What's going to happen is going to happen?\", \"All right. So let's start with the lead now. Pick up with me now. You don't want to make it bad impression in this whole court proceeding with a DUI. What do you think you could do that would make a bad impression?\", 'I would do it.', \"So you want to avoid those behaviors for sure. So you know, for sure you don't want to have sex? Would it be acceptable those things anyway?\", 'So would you appreciate those skulls like avoiding those situations I go in the court truck', 'Goals that you could get behind', \"You're not striking me as overly enthusiastic about this idea.\", \"this is really tough for you is the outcome. The marriage laws are important. Yeah, this whole this book, do you I think it's really just encroached on something you had going on that you enjoyed. Yeah. So is this an inconvenience that you can move past or is this a major life with fat that is gonna change things\", \"But if there's a condition of your treatment, the judge says no more drinking is no more marijuana period. We can see that that if you obey those rules or word, jail\", 'I would think it almost certainly would have happened. Yeah.', 'back a couple of steps. How long have you been using the alcohol marijuana?', \"Have you ever until now with the DUI, have you ever envisioned stopping? Now, what's your plan? Like pre d? Why was your plan and all this?\", 'Yeah. So without this or something you would have continued using?', 'until now. Yeah. Could this be a strange way like an opportunity?', 'If you really wanted to stop because your stuff', \"you could give a shot. You're just not sure you could. You could actually do it.\", \"It's just unknown.\", 'So where do you want to go from here you have this to you, I imagine a hearing or some type of Coming up here to see me. What can I do to help you?', 'like a like a place in terms of your thinking like your mentality.', \"Okay, you want to work on that? Yeah. So between now I'm gonna see you again. Do you have any hearings or anything coming up? Now they're not for like a few more weeks, few weeks. So I'll see you again. And I have the IEP and everything here. second week. Let's pick up with that. They think changes we're hearing is moved up to slumping, okay. Okay.\", 'Thank you.', 'Pretty good. Can I ask you what handed only write with?', 'Your right hand would be all right to ask you some questions about your memory.', \"Okay, thank you.

Yeah. Because at first I was thinking daily. That's a lot of individual shopping trips, but it applies to all transaction.\", 'So this is a fairly significant source of anxiety for you.', \"So let's talk about that. And help me to understand this better. So let's say that you went to a convenience store, and just had one thing in mind, what might be a potential item that you would gum? gum, right? So you want to go in and you just want to buy a pack of gum. That's all you really want. That's why you stopped at the store.\", \"So you go in, you have any thoughts?

So is the anxiety', \"so it's really gradually\", \"Alright, so you so really the the worst anxiety would be approaching the store entering in that moment of uncertainty. When you don't know the second Yeah,\", 'Okay. So if you could relieve that anxiety, that would be one of your goals.', \"All right. So let's think about this way. Do you? Do you know the reason that you do this? You have any guesses?\", \"Alright. So you've been through some really tough times to put it mildly. And what You're afraid of if you only buy the one item? Is something safety related happening?\", 'And I guess security like the', \"So safety and security. They're at risk for you.\", \"When you don't follow this role, the rule and I will Yeah. So if we think about it in terms of the cognitive model, we talked about the core beliefs and the intermediate beliefs, which are the attitudes and assumptions expectations, so the core belief here the only thoughts when it might be\", \"I'm not okay. I'm not safe. I am vulnerable,\", 'Sure at risk? Yeah.', \"And then when a situation presents itself, which would be an impending transaction. That's the situation we talked about how the situation blends together. With that, in this case rule that intermediate. So when they come together, what's that automatic thought?\", 'trends potential transactions approaching you, and you handed me a belief I need to buy everything', \"And then what's the behavior? That is a product of that automatic thought of I do you buy the second item? Yeah. And the feeling is the feeling of falls.\", \"well, the follows on Mac thought, oh, anxiety, anxiety, and then what's the feeling that follows the purchase? Yeah. Relief relief. Alright. So can you see how the mechanism what's happening to you could be explained one explanation through through the cognitive load\", \"Alright. So let's talk about the rule of the Rule of Two. Now we, we, we talked before, we're talking about cognitive therapy, about useful and less than useful thoughts, right? functional and less functional or dysfunctional. thoughts. Do you think that sitting here now, not so much necessarily in the store? I know that's probably a different thought process. But talking with me now, do you see a causal connection between purchasing two items and a safety or security breach?\", \"it's not a useful in this case thought munei useful intermediate belief.\", \"So you recognize that you appreciate that. There is not a link between Elio purchasing here. And in either direction, though, right meaning, so you realize that, that if you buy to, this doesn't necessarily keep you safe either. So you can't introduce safety or the process of risk of being unsafe, you can't introduce risk or safety through your transacting behavior.\", 'Does that make sense?', 'So do overs or rest are not influenced by your behavior.', \"But that's not what your mind is telling you. That's not what your thoughts are telling you. That's logical. And you can sit here with me. And it's not easy to say, but you can say, Yeah, I don't see a link.\", \"So let's talk about that moment. So in this moment, maybe a little anxious now, but you can kind of see how, right you can't protect yourself or cause harm to yourself or anyone else. By buying to or failing to buy to write in the store, or wherever you make the transaction, different story. So you have, let's, let's go a different direction. I talked about how you walk into a store, and you think, well, I get those the phone, right? And you end up getting something else. Yes, the anxiety then kind of goes away. And we'll come up the next time that happens. But it's a way it's gone for that moment. So, I want you to kind of stay with me as I go through another scenario. And you maybe have figured out what I'm going to do here, but\", \"So maybe GM isn't the ideal example but you see my right yeah. See, you go into the now you go to the store, you realize you only have enough resources to make the one transaction and you really want it so zero is not. So, now walk me through the thoughts and the feelings\", 'would think would happen', 'Could you do it?', 'And that is one level of being able. But how about in terms of your thinking? And your feeling?', 'And what would happen? How much anxiety with you experience and with the anxiety fade off?', \"Are you worried is the kind of anxiety where you're worried that something catastrophic is gonna happen? Okay, so even talking about a transaction of one can lead to anxiety connected to this safety and security.\", 'So you can you can trigger that without a transaction even pending.', 'really scared sitting here.', \"is unbearable the anxiety of men's embarrassment?\", 'but does it hurt stuff?', 'What do you feel is gonna happen with seeing xiety about', \"Okay, so it's not a safety and security. It's a it's a concern about going through and buying one item on the rule. Those two Yeah, yeah. And I'm talking about breaking the rule.\", \"Because so you're anxious about that. And you're also anxious about the consequences of that.\", \"So the anxiety you're experiencing right now in this moment with me, I want you to be mindful that, guys keep that in your awareness and let me know if that changes. just interrupt me if you need to. It's not.\", 'So it might get worse. It might get better. So, is there something on your mind that you need to buy within the next couple of days?', \"That's a transaction of one.\", 'Okay, right. Yeah. understandable, but what if, what if I challenged you to behavioral Experiment. Okay, can you guess what that might be?', \"to buy one to buy one cup of coffee? And then I don't know where to buy the coffee, but leave? Yeah, wherever it is leave. So what are the possible things that could happen? Knowing that logically you can connect it to a safety thing, and you might be anxious about that. And that's real, that anxiety is real. But knowing that the event isn't prevented or caused by exactly the transacting behavior. Let's go through what happens. So you buy the coffee. You're really anxious. Right? up to it, you're anxious to go into driving there either.\", 'Would it go away?', \"So it'd be more painful experience to buy the one.\", \"But it wouldn't actually harm you.\", 'But it would cause you more internal anxiety.', 'So what would happen if you did again,', 'repeated 100 times.', \"So really, what you're doing is you're conditioning you'd be conditioning yourself right to, to to surviving just buying the one item. I have a lot more money financial advantages to it certainly. And there'd be a you know what I hope is a freedom advantage which is the freedom to buy any number of miners, the next so what what scenario of purchasing i know i i asked for the coffee example I mean I asked one thing you're going to buy the coffee, but what what scenario could you see yourself being most likely to fall through this? I don't know if the coffee is the optimal situation for that behavior experiment maybe I guess it would there be another item that would be easier to actually fall through like for example, the gasoline because you'd get your car by the gasoline and you leave. Yeah, that would be easier for you. You will be tempted by the other I\", \"wood. That'd be easy. It'd be, you know, might be\", \"So we will, we will consider that kind of a step in a direction that would result in fewer symptoms. Yeah, that would be wonderful. And maybe another step in the future if we get there. So it goes with us, but it would be to go into the store and buy one but let's not let's not do that. Okay. Let's stick with the gasoline.\", 'You feel like you could succeed with that. Yeah, experiment.', 'are you afraid with the coffee that you might just end up buying too? Okay.', \"So how's your anxiety now?\", 'Okay, so that was a stressor.', \"But mostly because the experiment that we're talking about somewhat easier\", \"So one of the we talked about before, what do I mag thoughts like adaptive responses, right. So as you're trying to kind of push through this experience of just feeling car, you're going to have those thoughts still come up. And the adaptive response could be something like, Well, I'd like you to design it or work with me and design it. But could be something like, I know this will actually have a consequence in the real world. Yeah, I realized this is just how responding internally doesn't take away the anxiety, necessarily. It might, but it will help you maybe get through that process. Yeah. Yeah. Does that make sense? Yeah, absolutely. There's a few things I'm asking you to do. Right. One is to just buy gasoline needed and only by gasoline. And at the same time when those thoughts come up to respond to them with the adaptive responses to compare the two.\", \"Apparently got it. Right. So I know this won't have real consequence. In reality, that could be one. And if you have any others, you know, you can apply to as well as apply them. I know that I can tolerate the anxiety. Yeah, seems like you've tolerated for a long time. It's not pleasant. It's not what you want. But you can tolerate.\", 'And maybe another adapter response would be, this is painful for me. But if I can be successful here, if I can get rid of things,', 'And keeping your island moving up to coffee and other other behavioral goals. Like that. Yeah, that makes sense.', \"So we're kind of attacking anxiety from a lot of different angles here. Okay?\", 'So do you do believe that you can succeed with this idea?', \"Yeah. So well, that can be very Positive so that you know what I detected there was, you're ready to challenge the six idea. Right? Like, I would like to take the devil's courage. Yeah, yeah. So you're ready to say I've had enough. And you can see a clear path of behavior that can help you get through it and you're ready to take the anxiety on. That can be a positive adaptive response, right? Like being assertive and saying, almost like you're talking to the anxiety in a way okay, right, but I'm not gonna let you beat me this time. That's what you'd be saying to the anxiety.\", \"So, make a note of all these right? And you can use the same one more than once. You can mix them up, whatever works for you. Okay, but keep applying them as needed through the whole process into your home, your is your no more risk to go by. It's great. Yeah. Cuz it because I think once you get home really, that's, that's the completion of only participating that one transaction right, you've left and go back to restarting the cycle. So right. you've, you've permanently recorded just buying the one thing. Yeah, so that's a victory. Yeah. That'd be a huge victory. So I don't know if you know the status of your gas tank right now. Do you foresee needing to get gas between now and next week?\", \"So if you could try that out. And if you could record kind of in the moment, like after it's over the experience in terms of your feelings, different stages, that would be helpful.\", 'How can I help you today?', \"Okay. It really helped me if I could ask a few more questions about how you feeling? Yeah, maybe symptoms and then we can sort of see how it can help you with that'd be okay.\", \"So why don't you tell me a bit more about what's brought you here today?\", \"Okay, why don't we just look at one of those things at a time. Tell me a bit more about you say having trouble sleeping.\", 'Okay, and you have problems with your apetite.', \"And what's about sort of life in general you kind of lost you get up and go?\", 'you get up and go you your energy levels are low.', 'Can you just came back to sleep? Can you tell me a bit more about that? How much sleep Are you getting each night?', 'Sounds like your lack of energy and lack of sleep and lack of appetite. Seems to me that thing that seemed to really get you down.', \"You say you're a mess.\", 'Okay. It would be helpful for me just to sort of find out a bit more about home life or work life and ask a few questions in that area. Would that be okay?', 'So do you work?', \"I've got some patients who work in the same environments very high pressures\", 'and who else is at home with you?', 'Do they get to their their father much?', 'must be quite hard on both you and them.', 'Does she live locally?', 'What about you? What about your hobbies and things you enjoy?', \"Well I know you've you're not a doctor but you must have had thoughts about what's causing all these feelings that you thought about about these these type of things\", 'what tends to bother you the most Is it the sleep or the your appetite or the energy or sleep coping with the kids asleep.', \"that was gonna be really well I'm going to ask next. I mean, what are your thoughts about how he could help you today?\", 'Would it be a good idea perhaps if we think about all the options available to you and then decide which which ones may be best for you', \"we might have heard of some of the talking therapies, being able to sit down and talk with us, sort of a trained counselor about about your feelings and about what's been happening.\", \"It may help you deal with some of your feelings. I take on board about the thoughts about using a sleeping tablet. I think that could be another option. Obviously, when the concerns we have is that we don't want to have you on sleeping tablets for a long period of time because their issues about becoming dependent on them and reliant on them. We can use them for a short period of time, say, for a week to help you get back into a bit more of a normal sleep.\", \"What's about those the two options as option the counselor, or perhaps sleeping pills?\", \"Okay, so you'd like to try both. I think that that sounds a good idea. Would you be happy to the counselor here at surgery?\", 'Okay, so I can organize that I can speak to her and ask her to contact you to make an appointment. It also be really helpful for me as well, if you could complete one of our heads questionnaires.', \"Sorry. It's a short questionnaire just asking some questions about your feelings and it'll help me to find out. If there's any more help, I can give you an annex, see if that's okay. From what you've told me today, I mean, it sounds really for the last 12 months or so you've felt really low. Since split from you, your husband.\", 'Your sleeps not being good. your appetite is not being good.', \"is sounds to me. Self esteems taking a real not because I certainly think the help we can give you with some counts in which we have a counselor that comes here in the surgery that will be it'll be a benefit to you. And then we'll try the short course of sleep tablets to try and get you back into a state sleep pattern.\", \"maybe I can see you in about two, three weeks time. And I don't want you to think that you have to sort of manage all this by yourself. I mean, that's why we're here. We're here to, to help and support you.\", 'Let me do the prescription then.', \"So that's gone to reception as you can catch up on the way out.\", \"And I'll give you one of the heads question as well.\", 'Complete that before we see you next time.', 'Okay, see  you next time.', 'Okay, bye bye.', 'So, are there any substances that you currently use?', 'Can you tell me how often you drink?', 'And what are you drinking?', 'To know what size', 'three bottles of beer a day.', 'And how much time does To take you to consumers,', 'So, every day, three beers and about two hours. Yeah. Does that do anything to you? In terms of your mood or feeling? Hmm,', \"So it's relaxing for you.\", 'Has it ever gotten you into any type of trouble?', 'All right, is there any other areas where it might disrupt functioning?', 'So, three, three bottles of beer, pretty much every day,', \"whichever is the time when you've consumed more or less than particular day.\", 'And how long have you been drinking alcohol?', 'Yeah. Was that you mentioned beer. Have you ever consumed any other type of alcohol', 'Any other substances you use currently', 'When did you first start using marijuana?', 'about two years ago.', 'On the weekends, sometimes other times', 'mostly on the weekends, occasionally during the week. Has it ever led to any trouble or change the function?', 'Have you ever tried to cut down on the substance use?', 'So you think perhaps the alcohol use is connected to the stress with your job?', 'Have you ever been annoyed by people that perhaps criticize your substance use?', 'That bothers you.', 'Have you ever felt bad or guilty about your substance use?', 'Have you ever had to drink or use drugs first thing in the morning to study your nerves or to lessen the effects of the hangover?', 'So on occasion that happens. Yeah,', 'So, Alcohol, Marijuana, two substances you currently use. Can you tell me about substances used in the past?', 'just the one time. Yeah, just the one time.', \"So that didn't last she just continued.\", 'Any other substances or just those two?', 'Do you have a family history of substance use?', 'Any other history?', \"before I moved to the next Section of the intake. While we're still talking about substance use, is there anything else you want to add in the comments you want to make about the section?\", 'So covered pretty well.', \"I appreciate you answering these questions. And if you're okay, I'm going to move from the section and move to the next section. The intake okay.\", \"So you're supposed to finish at 330 Why do you think you're not finishing it through 330?\", \"right, So that's really the problem that we'll get You work and there's no way you can fit into the the times that you were employed to work.\", \"I can see that I can see you're getting quite stressed about it. So have you had any thoughts about anything you might be able to do about this? Kathleen? Is there anything you think you could do?\", 'so you really do feel that you need to talk to the boss that includes you and explain what the problem is. Is this something you feel comfortable about doing?', \"Okay, because she was lovely there. She says, Do you think that if you were able to go and talk to her, that she'd actually be quite receptive to listening to you?\", \"okay. What I'm going to suggest Kathleen is that we do something called a role play. And what that is, is that we act out the situation, whatever it is. And in your case, it's going to be you going and talking to your boss and trying to explain to her that you've got a problem trying to fit your work into the house, which is supposed to be working. So you'll be playing, you end up playing your boss. Now, obviously, you're not going to get exactly the same responses from your boss that you'll get from me today. But it does give you a chance to think about the way you might approach it, to practice it, and to get a response that you can then react to and practice your way through a possible scenario. And what this could do happily Give you a bit more confidence about the swing.\", \"Well, we practice it right now. Oh, I can, what we'll do is, you'll be you. And I'll be the doctor that you're going to see. Let's just think about a couple of things to get it started.\", 'well, what do you think would be the best time of day to do it? Oh, topic day', \"Sounds like a good idea because then you don't have to worry.\", 'Okay, so have you had any got any thoughts about what you might say? How are you going to introduce?', \"That's fantastic.\", \"because that gives her the chance the opportunity to say well, No, it isn't. Could you come in five minutes. I'm sorry. Oh, Go straight into it. That's really good. Okay. Should we give it a try?\", \"So I'm gonna get you to stand up and pretend that you knocking on the doors that what you do. Yes, yes. All right. So I want you to get out and just do that and then come back in as if you're having to see your boss and the boss to tell me what to\", 'yeah', 'Yeah, sure. Good, thank you.', \"obviously you're employed 830 to 330  Kathlleine hours we want you to work so we don't want you working back so first of all, this is important that you know that we want you to leave at 330 and that's what I want you to do. But from what you're saying the work you're being given doesn't fit into those hours\", \"what's happening here I'm getting too much work from the other doctors\", \"I think I've got the picture.\", \"I'm glad you came to me. I really need this job. Look. I'm really glad you came to see But obviously 830 to 330 is not enough. It's a long day, early as you're supposed to work. So I need to have a look into this and see what's going on.\", \"Kathleen. Yes, I'll have a look at it. But I want you to make sure that you do leave at 330 every day.\", \"Obviously the responses that I gave are not going to be the ones you'll get from doctor because she is sure this is what she said she. So there'll be something similar, but the important thing is, I think, to work out that first opening gambit, isn't it and it's true and to do that, and then flow on so That's something I want you to think about. Perhaps a few. You guys come and see me next week and about a week perhaps.\", \"Well, let's look at it. What I'd like you to do is think about what we've done today. Yes, but but don't don't. Don't overdo it don't sort of keep it down for your mind. Well, exactly. That's what I was going to say. I can see that you're getting a bit, too.\", \"I know. Yeah. So having the right words is a help. That will help you to get a bit of confidence there. But importantly, I think we need to relax a bit, don't we? And there are some very simple relaxation exercises that I can teach you that I'd like you to go away and practice. So that horrified by next week when you come, you'll practice those relaxation exercises, because they have things that you can use anyway in any situation. I'll tell you what I know you don't have to lie on the floor. Not for these because that's not very practical before you go see your boss. So, what I suggest is we look at you coming back in a week's time and your practice the relaxation exercises, we'll go through them again, and we perhaps do another role play and then maybe we might be ready to go and do it for real. What do you think?\", \"So that would be a worst case outcome. You would be extremely upset. You're extremely upset now. While you're five out of 10 right now, but you're an eight when you're in bed in the morning. Yeah. Is it reasonable that a professional makes a mistake like that? This is the mistake of kind of missing something that normally would be caught. Is it reasonable? They continue on in the field and try to learn from that.\", \"Right, there might be consequences for that type of error. It's not intentional, something that like many mistakes would happen due to conflict confluence of circumstances who being tired of being the end of the day, not being honest. There's mitigation there. But still, I can appreciate you would want to make that mistake either way. What would your after making a mistake like that? What would your thought be? Would you be thinking?\", \"To my extension, I'll never feel okay about what I did. Yeah. And what do you think you would do then in terms of your reaction to that thought?\", 'What do you think would do to your performance?', \"So in a strange way, the anxiety, the thoughts you're having now that result in anxiety, are leaving you more at risk to make a mistake.\", \"Right, so one of the thoughts you're having now is you can't make a mistake because it would be too devastating. And that titles like this. I have a thought you're having. So it's like you can't make a mistake. And this is leaving you emotionally less prepared and probably increased risk of making a mistake.\", 'close friends. Yeah.', 'One or two?', 'How often you talk with them?', 'Have any romantic interest?', 'You were in an accident.', \"But we'll get to that in a bit. So you've had some, some boyfriends? Yeah.

I don't feel that Well, sometimes things get in the way. There's things that just prevent me from doing that. So I think our job together is to try to figure out what are the sort of barriers that make these sort of things difficult.

Well, I think something that will be useful for both of us, Charles is to collaboratively work together and figure out how we can look at the perceived benefit of doing some of these things. versus the cons. So there's a worksheet that I have called a decisional balance worksheet. And it basically takes two separate decisions. One decision is to engage in activities, and there's some benefit to doing that. And then another decision would be to not engage in activities. There's benefit to that. But there's also cost to both of those decisions. So I think one objective way for you to look at this worksheet would be to determine what are the sort of things you could do and determine whether there's more benefit or cost to completing that? What do you think about that?\", \"Okay, that's a great idea. So what would be a benefit of calling a friend or meeting someone for lunch?\", \"Okay, that sounds great. So sounds like one benefit would be you'd enjoy the company. Yeah. And you wouldn't be as lonely. So I'd write that down. Okay, good.\", 'Okay, can you think of the downside to potentially doing that?', 'Okay, or', 'So it sounds like the most practical one of those would be that he may be busy.', \"Okay. So I'd write that is a great job Charles with the top two boxes with the first decision. So let's move to the second decision, which would be to stay the same and there's some benefit to that and there's some cost to that as well. Sure. Okay, Charles, so we completed the worksheet.

So, which activity doesn't make the most sense to try for homework this week?\", \"Okay, that's a good observation.

Okay, so, Barbara, I'm seeing you today. But I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you. Is that right?\", 'Okay. What is it this boy you see me today?', 'Right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems?', 'So quite a few symptoms and some of them sound more troublesome to you.', 'And how long has this been going on?', 'Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday?', 'Okay.And What sort of treatments have you tried for this before?', \"So these different tablets that you've got from the herbal shop, how are you taking them?\", \"So my my writing thinking you perhaps decide on a day to day basis, what you're going to take depending on what your stomach's doing.\", 'okay. Okay. And what About tests if you have any tests for these problems.', \"they're are the gastroscopy?\", 'Okay.', \"Right. sounds as though you're not happy with that?\", 'Right', \"So you feel as though actually enough hasn't been done in the way.\", \"It sounds like you've had these problems now for about four years, you've you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. You've tried a lot of tablets, some prescribed some herbal remedies, and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that you've been investigated thoroughly enough. Is that is that about it?\", \"Right. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how is all of this affecting you day to day, how's how's it affecting your life?\", \"That's something you quite enjoyed.\", 'Okay.', 'right', \"Yeah, it does, It does sound as though over the last few years, your life has really changed quite a lot because of the symptoms. It's It sounds like you're doing very few of the things that you used to do.\", 'What is it you spend your average day doing now?', \"Right. Okay. Okay. And have you been any times of the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms for example, have there been any times when things have been better for you?\", 'Right. And how were you told me symptoms then?', 'nice', \"right, That's interesting And are there any times when you Tummy symptoms bother you More seem particularly bad?\", \"so you notice it's the worst when your husband's not around.\", \"Right. Now, you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong here?\", 'Right Okay. Um, what do you think?', 'And if you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it', 'right', \"So you're, you're kind of prodding having a feel at night just to see if you can feel anything.\", \"Right. Okay. Okay. So just to make sure that I've got the story straight you've, you've seen Dr. Brown for couple of years, you've tried a variety of medications, some prescribed some from the herbal shop, and none of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations, but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And times you worried that this could be something quite serious like a cancer. Is that if I got the story, right,\", \"Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today?\", \"Right. Right. So you're hoping that I'd send you four more tests?\", \"Right. Okay. Well, I think Barbara having having heard his story and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and they've not shown anything. And you symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So it'd be I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests.\", \"No, I think that you clearly have pain. And it clearly you have lots of physical symptoms and they clearly getting in the way of your life and causing you a lot of disability. I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body. Sometimes these things can go together. I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year when your son got married, and you were very busy and quite happy that somehow your symptoms seemed less and when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much. Sometimes somehow his symptoms then will seem greater. So I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara is if the might be some kind of a link with you between how you feel In your mind and what's going on in your life, and and how much you symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility?\", \"I'm not saying that the pains in your mind. I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really with those, none of those have really helped you. I guess I'm wondering whether now, it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems.\", \"Well, I guess, thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life. I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life's really changed. It seems to have been Really shrunk down. And it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do that you used to get pleasure out of, is that right?\", \"And I guess I wonder it sounds as though you've you've dropped doing those things, because you felt you couldn't do them. But I wonder if in a funny way, what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now, has kind of fed into you feeling unhappy with the way that that your life is at the moment. And I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you?\", \"I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life and what you do with your day. And maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things. Even if it's just meeting up with your female friends once a week. And whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally improve your quality of life. I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking. And the fact that you, you seem to be taking quite a lot of them and wondering whether it's worth of sitting and looking at them and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit and really decide which are helping you, which are doing nothing, and which may actually be making some of these symptoms Worse, I guess. What would you think about trying that slightly different approach for, say, two or three months just to see whether or not it makes any difference?\", \"well, I guess, if we if we did decide to work together like this, this new approach, I'd be seeing you regularly, we can keep an eye on your symptoms and if they change then we can investigate as appropriate proof They stay the same, then, you know, we could be pretty clear that there's nothing new happening that that we're missing. How would that sound?\", \"I think that would be a good idea. I think we've only just begun talk about it. And I think perhaps you need to have a bit of time to think about it, and then perhaps come back, perhaps if you booked him for a double slot next week. And that would give us a good chunk of time to think about this new approach. And perhaps if you could also bring your your tablets in or make a list of them. We can look at what you're taking and perhaps go from there. How would that sound Barbara?\", 'Yes, I think so. I think that would be a good, a good start.', 'Okay. All right. Okay. All right. So see you again next week', 'All right. Thank you Barbara.', 'bye bye', \"Yeah, it's something really different for you.\", \"Well, why don't you tell me a little bit about what brings you here today?\", \"So you're, you've heard a little bit about the program here. Would it help if I just explained a little bit about what what my role might be today?\", \"What I want to reassure you of is that I'm not here to try and tell you anything that you might need to do or to try and give you advice or information at all. I'm here to help you in whatever way is useful to you to sort out what what's going on and what if anything you'd like to do differently. So this is really up to you. What you would like to explore today, how does that sound?\", \"So right now you're feeling a little overwhelmed with everything that's going on, and you're not even sure where to start.\", 'Yeah. So now anything any kind of decisions you make, or anything that you do affects both you and and the baby.', \"Well, I if you're interested or you're willing, why don't you tell me a little bit about your story?\", \"So the in the history of the relationship over this year, it's kind of been in and out in a way and there have been Some incidents where you've had some arguments and then separated for a while and gotten back together but it does sound like something pretty significant happened that sort of freaked everybody out. All all of you the baby and you and him and, and was kind of scary.\", \"So in a way it doesn't, it didn't even really make sense to you or to him, because on the one hand, He's really good. Good with you and good with the Father. I mean, good with your child. And on the other hand, it was just like, what is this something really different?\", 'What are your thoughts right now about some of the options out there for you to do if, if anything, what are what are you thinking about?', 'gotten pretty isolated ?', \"So you had been kind of thinking about maybe going back to work and doing doing some of that on your on your own and, and yet He, he doesn't really he's expressing that he liked to be able to take care of you. And, and when he's there, he does take care of you.\", \"Does that leaves you in a real bind when you're, you're there and you don't have what you need?\", \"So you've kind of find yourself when you're in that bind, trying to find ways of, of getting getting what you need.\", \"I just want to say we can go over some things that are potential to talk about to really focus on that might help you. But I just want to let you know that this is, I really appreciate how hard this is to be able to talk about it. And it's it's not an easy situation, and you're definitely not alone. And I really appreciate your willingness to talk about it.\", 'Yeah I know. There are lots of different things that we can talk about that are that that many women in very similar situations find themselves and things that we can talk about and focus our conversation on that might help you just sort of sort out and Figure out what if anything that you want to do differently or how to what your next step might be?', \"And and some of those that we work with are like talking about the relationship, you've mentioned a few things about your, your relationship and how it kind of goes in and out and it's can be really good and, and then he can be gone for a while and just sort of sorting some of that out about where you are with that. We can certainly talk about resources about the resources in the community that may be there for you, or in terms of your own understanding. But also if you if you are in need of additional help, we can talk about those. We can talk about safety planning. I mean, one of the one of the important things is to try and help you find a way to make sure that you feel good about keeping yourself and in your baby safe. And we can talk about that. We can talk about finances. You mentioned that you were thinking about going back to work but that you were relying on him right now. We can certainly For that a little bit more, taking care of yourself which,\", \"Yeah, yeah, for many, many new new moms that's hard under any circumstances to find a way to take care of themselves and keep themselves healthy. So that's certainly something we can talk about. And also just the whole issue about taking care of your child and, and your, your mothering your parenting, how you might, how you might focus on that and in this situation, or there might be something else that you feel is really important to deal with right up front. Just to start with, what do you think?\", \"so maybe you spend a lot of time already thinking about your relationship and really struggling with what what it means and where it is. And now you're kind of think well, maybe I think about some other things and see where I might go with those.\", \"so might be a way that focusing on how you might be able to take care of yourself get get a job or look at the possibility of doing that and the same time trying to incorporate you're taking care of your child that those things might help you um Free you up to figure out then what to do about the relationship?\", \"Yeah. You know, you're the only one that that really will know about that about the dealing with the relationship about what, when the timing is right for any decision that you make one way or the other.\", \"Yeah. Well, and it sounds like you'd like to think about making some decisions in other areas. And, and when you think about that, is that right? Would you like to focus a little bit on just the possibility of getting a job? If that's something you'd like to talk about?\", 'Well, you mentioned earlier that you had kind of been thinking about going back to work when after the baby was born, what what thoughts do you have about how you might go about balancing that? And and in thinking about thinking about that, what have you thought about?', 'So you might have to explore some other options for the child care and in other ways of taking care of the baby so that you would be feel okay about going back to work?', \"It really does sound, though, like you, you're really deeply committed to taking care of your child and providing the kind of structure and, and, and things the basic needs and really taking care of your child at the same time.\", 'Right', 'Like being jealous, not wanting you to have friends?', \"but it's, we've mentioned that a couple times now that it that it sort of surprises you, the way you're thinking about it in the way you're approaching it. Like you're recognizing we're seeing that you've spent a lot of time really agonizing over over the relationship and, and why things are happening in the relationship or what it really means you've spent a lot of time there. That kind of surprises you that you might be thinking about it differently\", \"So you're realizing to how much it really takes to focus attention on on the baby. And to be able to Do it and it's like I it's hard to do both. It's hard to really think about doing both.\", 'Hmm', \"Well, one of the things that we we look at is trying to help people who are in a situation similar to you where, where there might be some where there might be some fear about something that could that might happen, or you know, and I know you said he had indicated that he wouldn't do it again. But sometimes it really helps people to feel to have some plans in place for what you would do if anything came up and how to get you and your baby safe, if that's what needs to happen.\", 'He just went farther this time?', \"Yeah, yeah. And, and, and sometimes that ties in with, you know, there might be places that you can go to get saved, there might be steps that you can take to, to really keep yourself safe or make sure that the baby's safe for people to call or think just things that you can do based on what your life is like and what you what resources you have available to you. Is that something you're interested in really exploring?\", \"Some ways it just seems like it shouldn't have to be that way.\", \"really took you by surprise. It's something that you're just trying to figure out where, how does this fit and what it what does it mean? And what do I do with it? What what how do I how do I respond to this?\", 'Yeah. Well, let me see if I if I got it all and then we can make some decisions about where to move from here or how to take the next step with that. I want to make sure I understand a little bit about your situation.', \"And this first of all, this is the first time you've come in. This is the first time that you've had something that really happened, this incident that happened where he pushed you really prompted you to to take some steps because it scared you and you you are wanting to protect yourself and your baby. You Really want to protect the baby, you have this relationship that's been cut off and on and but he's been very supportive and helpful in terms of giving you meeting your basic needs and the baby's basic needs and wants to take care of you and, and there are times when it's really good. And there are times when you've been less sure and this is this incident has also made you to kind of think about that some of the ways that you've been thinking about or thinking about it now kind of surprises you but you're looking at thinking about the possibility of maybe working it out to go back to work a little bit so that you can have more financial independence, if you will, or be able to take care of yourself at the for those times when you need to. And you're starting to toy with the idea of maybe it might be useful to have a really good plan to keep yourself safe. Did I kind of get it all\", 'Yeah.Yeah. So maybe we can, we can take that next step in and when when when we get together again and we can do that we can just take the next step and start looking at some planning for both of those in both of those areas for keeping yourself safe and, and for, you know, looking at the possibilities because there are options and resources out there should you choose to make the decision to go back to work, there are some options for you.', 'There are other options for for a variety of things and we can make some have some discussions about that.', \"Well, I really appreciate again, you're coming in today, and we will follow up with this conversation and in it, you you will have it hopefully to give you what you needed to make any decisions that You need and again they are your decisions about what if anything you want to change and what your next step is.\", \"Yes, let's make another appointment.\", \"So if I go, I'm going to make a mistake. And then we talked about your reactions being late. Worry, anxiety. So what we'd like to do when we identify on that felt like that is what's called self talk. And it first this may seem a little odd, right? So you have this thought that comes through it can be an image to the thought image. But it's cognitive in nature. And I can't make a mistake, like, I'm going to make a mistake. I'm going to make a mistake. That's your thought. And the self talk. This is like a rehearsed statement that you literally say to yourself, which again, I get to that seems so odd The first time I do it. So really, you're talking to yourself But over time, we believe if you can keep applying the self talk strategy that you will eventually change the outcome, the reaction and change the underlying belief. Okay? It first though it's going to seem quite foreign to you. Tell me how you how you're processing this now.\", \"It's a good question. We'll work on that. And that's what we can do now. Let's take a look at some self talk. So some adaptive responses so they can build. So I'm going to make a mistake. That's the automatic thought that's directly leading. Seems to be to feeling supported dread, and physically not getting work on time. Has there ever been times when you've had that thought? And you went to work on time still?\", 'What was different about those times?', \"Alright, so when you do that, in essence, you are applying self talk. Okay. All right. So that's, that's really the same thing except you probably didn't have a label for it. And when you apply that it seems to work. So the message you're kind of sending yourself now you're telling yourself is I'm going to make a mistake still. But if I'm late for work, I'll be worse. So there's a little bit of positive and negative in here. Right self talk doesn't have to be all positive self talk needs to be, I think when anything realistic and sometimes realistic includes a little negativity. I'd rather focus on the more positive elements as we build this as possible though, so that's pretty good self talk you have now let's work on refining it a little bit to maximize its benefit.\", 'Okay. Yeah. I know when we met last time for your intake. You were concerned about some presentations that you had to give at school. Yeah. And you want to talk about that today?', 'Alright, so was there a time for like, recently when you had to give presentations?', 'How would you consider those?', 'So this presentation you gave with that received a poor score, maybe it was just an isolated incident.', 'But that experience has still led to a lot of things anxiety with subsequent presentations,', 'All right. So, would it be okay if we kind of step through the whole process of giving a presentation', \"Just before I start with that, is this something that leads to anxiety? Like right now or other times are really just in that moment when you're presenting?\", 'Okay, so you start feeling anxiety. A few days before presentation?', 'When does it start to get really distressing for you?', \"Okay, so would you be okay if we step into this process and kind of break down the steps of the presentation? Alright, so let's so what's one of the classes you're taking now?\", \"So let's say you have a presentation in that class a few days from now. I just have just a normal presentation. Yeah. All right. So, Let's now move to two days out, where you would start to feel a little anxiety about it. Yeah. What's going through your mind at that two day out point?\", 'All right. So your thought is, did I do enough preparation?', \"So that's that's the thought you're having 40 hours before the presentation. I'm not prepared enough. And kind of thinking about that thought. And what happens afterward? Do you have a reaction like any type of emotional, affective, affective reaction to that?\", 'And that goes substantially unchanged that feeling for how long?', 'Right, so the same type of thought just more intense, more intense and the feeling is also more intense.', 'doing all right?', \"a little better and even down for a while what's going on?\", 'This is unusual for you because usually, when I come in, you come in and talk to me cut down or depressed, something changed recently.', 'Can you tell me about the solution you found for your question?', \"You want to commit suicide? You know how you'd do that?\", 'When do you plan on doing this?', 'What kind of things to to arrange?', \"So Jill, you've been seeing me for almost a year now and you know, by telling me this, that I'm gonna act to stop you. But I'm gonna try to stop you from killing yourself.\", 'You seem pretty serious, though, about your timetable in your plan.', 'Is there anything that can stop you?', \"Do you feel like it's the depression or something else that drove you to this decision?\", \"as you said, it's a solution.\", \"I know we've, we've talked about this issue in the past, right? And when you've come in feeling this way, kind of resolved harming yourself. We sent you over to the hospital. I know that's not your favorite place. But when you go there for however long it's been usually what five days come out feeling a lot better.\", 'Do you feel like this time would be different?', \"So like I say, a part of you saying that. You don't want me to stop you. But yeah, you came in here and you told me, so part of you seems to you maybe not quite sure.\", 'hasn it helped you gaining clarity?', 'mean a suicide?', \"Sometimes and you know, you've been with me, like I said about almost a year now and you've been depressed much that time. And it's not unusual. When somebody thinks they found a solution to depression, even if that solution something that I am against, like suicide, that their their mood would become elevated because you see an end to pain. There's other things we can do and have done the past, try to get you out of pain.\", \"But I'm not going to it's my obligation with it I'm happy to fulfill to try to keep you alive. I've seen you this way before and I know it may not seem this way now but when you came out from a suicidal thoughts and feelings you did well for weeks, sometimes months at a time. You're seeing really just the darkest when you're in the\", \"Temporarily, because you feel you found the end to the pain which I understand. I mean, Understand you feeling better, but you're feeling better because you plan on killing yourself. And we've talked about how devastating that would be to your family, right? your friends.\", \"So your logic is that if you end your life, you'll freed them from having to deal with\", \"And as you know, I mean, you've signed releases, I've talked to your husband, your parents, they've repeatedly said that, despite sometimes the challenge of dealing with depression, they would much rather Have you alive, Why would they say that?\", \"So they'll feel good over the grief?\", 'I understand.', \"You know, I've been doing this for a while. Right. I think we've come to have a good relationship.\", \"And I would hope that I've earned your trust and you value my opinion. We'll do something that I know about suicide. You open  to hearing it?\", \"There's a lot of ways that people die. Right. And it's, it's really what eventually will happen to us all. It's hard for me to imagine way more devastating than suicide. Meaning when somebody dies of an illness, or a car accident or any other type of tragic accident, people grieve, right? But there's usually not a blame assigned to that mean they don't feel guilty. Does that make sense?\", \"They feel sad because they've lost the person, but they don't feel responsible for that person's death. Suicide is different, when somebody commits suicide, their family and friends feel responsible. They have no answers to all the questions that they have. They could never get an answer.\", 'So you believe the note will take away all that pain?', \"it'll mitigate that pain?\", \"Okay. I can tell you from experience that notes, notes don't really help. If anything, it's another artifact that they can agonize over. I know it's hard to see from your perspective, because you're kind of resolved to this and you feel stuck in the pain you want now, but they will miss you and they will agonize for the rest of their lives, because they've lost you. And it's a it's a special horrible type of agony that comes with feeling responsible for causing someone's death. I know you don't want that.\", \"I know it's frustrating. I know it's hard to understand. The times when you've gone to the hospital before, you have felt better. Your outlook was completely different, not 100%. But it was completely different when you came out. I mean, you're still a little down, but nowhere near the depression we'd want to hurt yourself. Is it possible if you go to the hospital this time, you could come out feeling better again?\", \"I'm gonna make arrangements to get you out of the hospital. I know. I know you don't. And we've had this conversation before. Right? I realized that, you know, you're not happy with some of the conditions there. But you usually talk finally about the groups. Right? You usually do well in the groups. And typically, well, every time right, every time you've been in the hospital, you've come out feeling better. I know it's not what you want to hear. I know you want me to be happy that you're gonna enjoy life, but that would make me happy. That would make anybody happy. I know you think it would make you happy. But I can tell you it's not the answer. I'd like you to go voluntarily through this process. Will you do that?\", \"All right. I'll go make those arrangements and we can show you. Okay?\", \"I think that was you'd come in after, after the relationship ended. Is that right?\", 'Okay. Okay. Can I just check of the bandage to open up a second down there?', 'Okay, okay. How have you been Jane since we last saw ?', 'Right. And this is Your boyfriend, Mark, is that right?', 'Okay. Okay. How long have you two been together?', 'Right. What was it that happened Jane to bring, bring that relationship to an end?', 'So was it after he had gone that you cut?', 'Right. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened when you cut?', 'Right', 'And did that help with the pain and the voices?', \"So, with the cutting is this something that you've, you've done before\", 'Right. Okay. And it sounds like there are times when you do it when it it helps.', 'Right', 'Right. And are there any downsides to the cutting?', \"Right. Okay. Okay. And you mentioned Jain voices, And I know you've spoken to doctors about them before.\", \"but can I just ask you a few more questions about and please, if that's okay. Okay, can you tell me? How long is it that you've been hearing the voices?\", 'And do you know other is, how many voices are there or who they are?', 'Right.', 'What kind of things Does your mom say?', 'Right. Okay. And how often is it that you get these voices', 'Right. Did you think they were in the room?', \"So can I just clarify that other voices seem as though they're inside your head? Or was it like my voice coming through your ears?\", 'okay. Okay. Okay. And am I right in thinking that they they trouble you more at times when you get stressed out?', 'Okay. Okay. Can I ask you a few more general questions about how you are in your mood? How, how would you say that you, you feel generally kind of in yourself.', \"Sounds as it can be very difficult sometimes. It sounds like you've used cutting in the past to help are there any of the things that you do to help when you feel really bad.\", 'Okay, and that was in the past, but but not recently.', \"And can I ask Jane, it sounds like when you cook the other night, you were doing it, sort of to kind of get rid of the pain. Can I just clarify where you're doing it to try and kill yourself.\", 'Okay. Have there ever been times in the past when you have tried to kill yourself?', 'So that was in your late teens and at the time you took the tablets because you wanted to be dead. Is that right?', \"Okay. Okay, but you've not wanted to be dead since that time in your late teens?\", 'Okay. Can I ask a few more general questions about your home situation? Who is it Is it is there anyone at home with you?', \"Right? So she's gone to live with her dad that quite recently\", 'and what was what was that about?', 'the relationships you had?', 'Can you tell me a bit more about that?', 'Right. And it sounds like your daughter struggled with that.', 'Okay. Well, there are lots of relationships like that.', \"Okay. You've seen Jane a few people in the past you've seen a couple of psychiatrists and a couple of counselors. As anything that anyone's done for you before been particularly helpful.\", \"So you've not found anything that people have done particularly helpful in helping you to manage your relationships and your cutting and the things that seem to go wrong for you.\", 'what do you think it would be worse? Given that this this has been such a long standing problem clearly does get gets in the way, quite a lot of aspects of your life. Do you think it would be worth us? meeting again one more time, and perhaps having a think together about how the service could best support you with this?', \"Well, the way that we work here in this department is that we we see people once or twice and try and think with them about the best place for them to be and then refer them on to the most appropriate parts of the service. So it wouldn't be usual for me to see. See you more than once or twice Strain\", \"I know it's very difficult to open up to people and I know that you have opened up here today and it can feel quite hard that you're not going to continue to see me but it is the way that we work here is to pass you on to somebody who is perhaps a bit more appropriate for your needs Jane. So would it be okay for me to book you in to come back and see me say next week for a second appointment and we can perhaps have a think of where to go from there.\", \"I'm doing well.

Instead, they asked us which day\", 'In what ways you get upset?', 'Alright, so that upsets you. And that upset them that whole incident? Yes.

Okay, this fell back to me I see that's a good good start back to me. Good Practice saving stay here and stay here in the room with me here. Yeah. And also get your character on that's it. Okay, so just just want you to just to keep in the room with me a bit and sometimes it's a bit bit stressful and overwhelming. Okay, but we're still connected. Okay, you're back there. Okay. How you feeling? completely understand why things are really, really tough at the moment. And that sort of conversations with a place in town could be very stressful for you.\", \"So maybe a feeling now, where you are? Yeah. Okay, so maybe just want to keep talking.

It's completely, you know, understandable that sometimes it's difficult to talk. And sometimes you can afford back to tough times. Yeah. So we just keep talking. I would keep talking like this\", \"you're okay. Glad to hear that. Yesterday, when you're here at the agency, you took a few different tests. Remember that?\", 'One of the tests you took is called the SCL 90, the symptom checklist 90. Do you remember taking that test?', \"It's 90 items. And they are ranked\", 'Not true and false are numbers that you solve.', 'So I have the results from that test. I want to review some of those findings with you.', \"So this particular instrument has a number of what we refer to as sub scales. So these are areas that are measured by the instrument, right? For example, depression or anxiety. So I'm going to review a few of these sub scales, ones where you scored a little higher than we might expect. And just review those with you and see. See what you're thinking we can talk about.\", 'No', \"Is it what makes you think I'm recording?\", 'It happens to you a lot that you get recorded.', 'Remember the last time it happened?', \"And you think you were recorded while you're taking this?\", \"That sounds worrisome. That's that's a feeling you get a lot that you're being recorded.\", 'You worry about it a lot.', \"You're certain that's happening?\", \"Where you're not being recorded now. I know. It probably feels like you are, but you're not. Okay.\", \"in school, right? I that would make sense. So, say for instance, you had a percentile rank of 65% Right percentile, that would mean that your score is equal to or higher than 65% of people that took that test. Okay, so that makes sense. So if you took a test on math or English, and you would say 75 percentile, you'd be higher than three quarters of people took the test. 75% Okay, understand? Does that make sense? I think so. Okay. If you want me to come back to that later, just let me know as I go through if it doesn't make sense, okay. So areas here on on the SCL results, or you were a bit higher than we would normally see. A one is the phobic anxiety scale. on that one, you were about 64 percentile. So your score was as high or higher. Than 64% of people who take it\", 'more than half the number and half the people in the same situation as you in outpatient mental health treatment.', 'It does seem that way. Yeah. So this construct would measure things like being afraid of going out being afraid of being a crowds. Does that connect with you? Is that seem like a fear that you have?', 'Tell me about that.', 'So it does appear you have kind of phobic anxiety symptoms. So that that score today that 64 percentile. That kind of makes sense.', 'I want to move on to the next one, which is paranoia. On this one, you were at the 84th. percentile. So quite a bit higher.', \"But this, this wasn't recorded, nothing was recorded here. Understand that's a worry that you have.\", 'in your particular case, the only people will be shared with this the rest of the treatment team and anybody that you sign a release for,', \"There's no reason right now I did that there are certain limits to confidentiality. But in your situation here at this clinic, there's no reason I would share this information with the government or, or anybody else other than people indicated. So the rest of the people here to treat you. And if you wanted to release the results to somebody, you could sign a release I would let them have the results.\", \"Well, I assume you're worried that\", \"Oh, I understand. Okay. So these things are really happening. Yeah. Right. But the test is arranged so that it's making it look paranoid when you're not exactly\", \"So that would explain why your score is elevated on the scale. Okay. Is that? Is that what you're thinking?\", \"And I wanted you to know that. I appreciate you telling me that. Do you think it's possible that it's working the other way around that the test is measuring something that is actually there?\", \"You don't think so. Okay.\", \"you believe their situation is different than yours. Okay, I understand. So the last area, the last subscale I want to discuss this one global scale on discuss. Glass subscale is one that's referred to as psychoticism. And there you are at the 93rd percentile. And that's when maybe you can hear things other people hear or see things that people don't see, or have beliefs or thinking that are far outside the norm and can't be supported by evidence. They feel like that's happening to you.\", \"There's There's nothing here that would indicate that I'm gonna put you away or center anywhere. Yeah, I just really this The purpose of this is just to discuss the results to make sure you understand kind of how these inform our treatment of you. Like so we're gonna provide treatment to impart based on these results.\", 'Okay, so this is a this is a score that makes makes sense to retake the test might be right.', \"but you believe you're being recorded, you're starting to that.\", 'Well, a little bit higher than we want to see.', \"So at the Paranoid if that if that scale was accurate, in your estimation, your global severity might be lower, I think, yeah. Closer to the 50 percentile, I think. So, even if you were closer to the 50 percentile, you can To understand how we're concerned that your symptoms are somewhat severe, and we want to make sure we deliver treatment to address that. Sure. Is that okay?\", \"So I will meet with the counselor that will be treating, you're here, and I'm going to go over these scores now explain to her what you've explained to me. Okay, in terms of why you think you might have received the score. Okay, I'll go over that with her. And of course, you could discuss it with her too, and she'll have the results of this test in your chart.\", \"She, she's not going to be recording. Okay.\", \"Okay. I appreciate you allow me to go over this set of results with you. And I'm going to show you assigned to that counselor and we'll move forward with treatment.\", \"Great. I'm doing okay. Thanks for asking. I see that you signed a release. So I could talk to your mother and I see she took in here today.\", \"Tell me what's going on.\", 'just like how you smoke. Yeah. But', \"yeah You're so you're concerned. Somewhat but\", 'what are you smoking house are concerned?', \"She's upset about that.\", 'are there any other drugs or alcohol or anything that you consume? Well, yeah,', \"not something she's concerned with?\", 'Are you concerned with alcohol or marijuana?', 'meals I guess you probably know, ask a few questions about', 'Can you tell me when you first started using it how they came about?', 'it took the anxiety away. Yeah. How long did you have the anxiety Before this?', \"So you started. You started marijuana because a friend offered to you and because you're anxious. Yeah. And then how about from then on\", 'When was the last time you used', 'this morning?', 'Did anything happen in particular that we think motivated your mother to bring in today.', 'So what do you want to happen? Would your goal be', 'in order to make her happy would you have to stop?', 'she wants you to get a job too.', 'Would employment involve drug screening?', 'Not to worry about that right now.', 'I would like to ask a few questions about marijuana use.', 'Have you ever tried to cut down', 'Have you ever taken in larger amounts and you want it to for long periods', 'How much time do you spend obtaining using recovering from marijuana', \"It's a big part your life\", 'has it led to any social problems where?', 'as the marijuana use caused you to give up activity so important to', \"That's not really has the marijuana use caused any activity become dangerous?\", 'Like driving law into the influence right now like that?', \"That's That's dangerous.\", 'Everybody does that. Now your mother, she drove you today. Yeah. She came when she worried that you were under the influence of marijuana.', 'Do you have any history of mental health disorders?', 'anxiety about medical problems?', 'Do you notice that when you stop using you have physical symptoms or anxiety?', \"what's the longest you have stopped for?\", \"So it's an every day activity for you.\", 'All right, Jackie. I know that your your mom wants you to get counseling here. Are you open to it?', \"Okay with Yeah, I'm gonna try.\", \"All right. I'll get you scheduled to see a casserole and we'll see where that goes from after your first appointment. I think it's better right?\", \"I want to thank you for Tell me what's going on for answering my questions has been helpful. Thank you.\", \"Okay, let's look at it real quick. Bring it over here.\", 'Okay, so anxiety is really high. What happened yesterday anxiety is really high can be quick summary', 'why?', 'I know', \"That's scary.\", 'kind of explains that number. Hmm ?', \"Well, I'd be anxious Of course. And it's kind of scary to see that. And what else did you think when you saw that?\", \"And your family wants you to learn to drive this year because you're 16\", 'And yet, you all you you keep complaining how you live in the middle of nowhere. And if you had a car you could like, go see friends more and get out of your lame Old Town and get to go do fun things.', \"True. That's true. And I won't get to see you anymore. Because you're dead. You know, I don't treat dead people right. Remember that? Yeah, okay. So on one hand, I know the idea of driving is completely overwhelming. And I know you're anxious, like all the time.\", \"so I'm wondering if we can bring it back to some of those things you're talking about to help reduce your anxiety. Maybe that's one idea to help you be able to get in the driver's seat. What do you think? So, essentially, you're practicing getting the driver seat by like doing this treatment and get in the driver's seat of your anxiety, as opposed to being a passenger and you're letting anxiety outside really your life? Because that's what you're doing. What do you think?\", \"I'm punning ain't I? So, here's an idea. Let's get on board. We start treating this anxiety. We do it really, really good. job at it we work hard. And idea driving might not be quite as scary. And let's face it being anxious driver increases your risk accidents.\", \"So reducing your anxiety, It's gonna make you a safer driver.\", 'True.', \"So here's what's interesting. You're really good at being really anxious. So you'll be really good at this. And it will go away. I promise you, I totally promise you.\", \"You know, done well, I'm the expert here of treating anxiety, and I promise you it will get better. I know everything. I know this. What do you think?\", 'All I do is totally, totally hard.', \"I know. It isn't. It's pretty insane, isn't it? I agree. Well, another option is you could just be anxious the rest of your life. Do they have a bus where you live?\", \"live with your parents for the rest of your life. I know I forgot. So you can live with your parents for the rest of your life. Because you're too anxious to leave town you won't be able to drive. So you could just live with your parents be anxious all the time, and you could go home so ideas on how to maintain your anxiety the rest of your life. You won't need to learn to drive. I mean, your parents are fairly nice. They probably drive around for the rest of your life, you know, until they pass away or something. In the meantime, what about that? So forget the whole treatment. I'm pushing you too hard. Why don't we just talk about how to maintain your anxiety? You're good at it.\", \"It's not meant to be funny. What do you think ?\", 'I really want to help you. I know being anxious every time Really hard. So one of the options is to really become good at being anxious, and do okay, and learn to sit with your anxiety. And another option is Yeah, getting more anxious to reduce your anxiety.', 'Yeah. For your practice at it.', 'All right. Do you want to review what some of the treatment strategies will be?', \"Okay, let's do that.\", 'When you say,', \"Okay, I mean, I'm having a couple three reactions to what you're saying. I mean, one is that you're saying you're all the same and\", \"I mean, I'm feeling just lumped in with everybody else right now.\", \"I mean, it's there's something specific right now that I could say or do that that would fill, give you what you're wanting or need.\", 'So you want sort of a, like a kind of, sort of like step by step description of', \"Yeah. See, my sense is that you know, that you sort of desperately want something to grab on to, to get to give you some sense of hope. And, and I really want to be able to, you know, to give you something but but it feels like there's something about the kind of intensity of your, of your sort of demand or play right now. Which, which makes it difficult for me to really sort of respond in a way that's going to give you what you need. Or, you know, a better way of putting it is, you know, have a sense that the kind of thing that you want or needing or needing has to kind of come out of an organic process between the two of us and there's something about the sort of intensity of your desperation with Which makes it difficult for you to really be open and receptive to whatever I have to give\", \"so it's like\", \"it sounds like it feels like you only have two choices, right that you can you can either approach the situation kind of on the attack, you know with with both guns blazing. It's a good way to describe\", 'Right or or the alternative is to kind of go along and compromise yourself in some way. Right. Right. Have those two which, which feels better, which feels worse?', \"Right. Yeah, I can imagine that right that right, if you end up you know, at least if you're going in there with with both guns blazing, there's a way in which you can kind of feel okay about yourself in some way, even though you're not getting your needs met. Right. But somehow they're, you know, sort of giving in, it's like you're giving away part of yourself in some way. So, I mean, you know, it seems to me that the you know, the dilemma is that you have no good way of getting your needs met right now, right. You sort of desperately need Something right, but a middle ground. There's no middle ground. Okay. So, you know, I'm not sure exactly what that middle ground is right now. But I'm willing to work with you to, you know, to really work on discovering what that middle ground is. Does that does that seem worthwhile?\", 'Okay, but what are you feeling right now?', \"There's a real kind of sadness there.\", \"Look at me. The sense of what's what's going on for us? It sounds as if here. You're asking for something. Yeah.\", \"Yeah. Yeah, I, you know, I hear that I hear the, you know, you're sort of desperation and I hear your sadness and your pain and your hopelessness. You know, when I'll do my best to help you\", \"Little stressed, What's going on?\", \"Okay, we've talked about some different struggles you've had as you balance work and school and everything. What specifically is bothering now it seems like you're a little more distressed today.\", \"what kind of grades you've been getting lately?\", 'anything else?', \"Okay. That's usually considered pretty good, right?\", \"okay, you're working hard to get the same grade?\", 'Have you been getting any feedback from professors or your classmates about your performance?', \"Alright, so before when you got A's you were working hard to have a job but not to the level of precision in terms of like the detail in the assignment that you are now. You're trying to get more information about the assignments, you're working harder to get the same grade that used to get before\", \"So when you're when you're having this feeling that I guess it's a feeling of anxiety or stress, yeah. What's going through your mind? What are you thinking about?\", 'So what grade would you have to receive for you to feel like you have failed', \"right below an A isn't A minus?\", 'What about A plus?', 'a B?', \"No, no, it'd be worse. Okay. So an A you can tolerate an A minus you're not exactly sure but you think you could\", 'But a B plus and a B?', 'so what would it mean to you if you received a B?', \"But you didn't try hard enough that you didn't do enough. What would it mean If that were true?\", 'That you were lazy?', \"Okay, now we we've talked before about automatic thoughts and cognitive distortions right in other sessions and one of the cognitive distortions is this idea that unuseful type of thinking and Aaron thinking is when you think of everything in terms of like, Black or White, all or nothing? So sounds like you have a little tolerance for like an A minus you're not completely there. But generally, it's kind of an A of some type, right? Or you're not interested. Right. So we get down to you didn't try hard enough and if that were true, the new would be lazy. Right? Which, you know, having senior these last few sessions is clear to me. You're not lazy. But that's the body.\", \"Now, it seems that earlier in your earlier years in the program, this was the Acer effortless for you, but you'd have to work as hard for them.\", \"what's what do you think has changed?\", 'You mentioned part of it was you can get close to the end, right. So is there anything else?', \"so if I'm reading you, right, you you really didn't have any competition for this award that you were aware of. Right? And now you feel like you really do,\", \"I'm paradoxically that's caused you to be more anxious and more stressed and your performing but you're still getting the A's which are working harder to get the A's,\", \"So what would it mean if you couldn't get the award if you didn't with the, what's the name of the new was first name with a new choice choice? Okay, but of choice once award, and you didn't want me?\", \"So its all or nothing if you don't win the award.\", \"Right, but you're not really losing a race because you would still graduate?\", \"You're you're just not getting a word, which you would like, right and which would be great. Right, and certainly accomplishment. But the reason you came to the program was to get the degree,\", \"but it's now it's now taken on some importance for you winning award has been a real goal.\", 'So with the new student choice coming in, I have this increased competition.', \"And that's causing me anxiety is caused you to work hard for the same grade. All right. So, as we talked before, you have a tendency to be, I mean, this as a compliment a little perfectionistic. Right. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing. It is taking too far, It can be right it can be not useful. Ever hear the phrase Perfect is the enemy of good. No. Does that make sense what that might mean?\", 'Yeah. So this desire to be perfect or to win the award is potentially causing you not even to perform well. Right?', \"you're still getting the A's but it's called the anxiety and you're working hard and\", 'So is there any way that you cannot win the award and still walk away? having accomplished worthy goals? Or does it have to be the award or none of this was worth it?', \"Your word validates all the hard work you've done.\", \"And in your mind, losing the award invalidates all the hard work you've done, right? But in reality, there's probably a between ground there might have been a shade of gray, where you're still an excellent student, you still graduate, you just don't have an extra plaque hanging on the wall, whatever the word is, right. That's really all you'd be missing. Right?\", 'With this award have any impact on employment?', \"And you didn't know about it when you first came in, and you're already working hard.\", \"So in a sense, and of course, we can't do this, for the sense of you could forget about the award. Right? You probably win it.\", \"Because you're already doing so well. But the thought of this potential failure, right away the word that's holding you back,\", \"Yeah, there's no there's no tolerance for any type of mistake?\", \"So so now that with the award out there, you really feel like you can't make any type of mistake or you just go right to, to a catastrophe?\", 'So free so for you to feel better about this one way, I guess right would be to not help have to not place so much value in way.', \"Yeah, you really want that. And it would be great. And that's okay. Right? We talked about the adaptive responses before, right? What are what's your automatic thought you have when you're sitting there and trying to get every assignment right and you you're kind of vaguely thinking about not losing or not winning this award was the automatic thought that comes to mind?\", \"yeah, when you're doing your work, and you sense that anxiety come on, right as you start maybe vaguely thinking about winning or losing this award, right? Like it's losing it Really? What's going through your mind right that moment?\", \"to ensure that you're gonna get that award?\", 'Right. So at a higher level, one of your thoughts is, I must win that award.', \"Does that make sense? I mean, that that's probably somewhere. Is there any type of adaptive response you could apply that moment, that statement, or kind of, well, that's an absolute statement, right? I must win that award. Is there any type of adaptive response you could play at that moment that could counteract that on thought\", 'Yeah.', \"Okay, so so you could say, it'd be nice to win the award. But in the end, it's not really gonna make the difference in my life in terms of my career\", \"and, and that's a fair, adaptive response, right? You do want to win it, right? Truthfully, and it would be nice to win it right. Who doesn't want to win the award, right? But if you don't, you were still good student. You're still gonna be a good connection and your career still good before. Do you believe in that adaptive response? Do you believe that adaptive response is true?\", 'So what percentage of the time Do you believe that adaptive response is true?', 'so 50% of time?', \"And the other half, you're not really buying.\", \"Okay. All right. So what advice Well, let's use choice, right? choices in the same situation, in a sense, in that she's, well, maybe not knowing what she is working toward this award as well\", \"Let's assume. Let's assume she knows about it. Right? He's in a similar situation. What advice would you give her?  She's kind of obsessing about this in the same way that you are.\", \"Your advice to her seems positive and uplifting. Mostly, your advice to her is more positive, uplifting what you're telling yourself internally,\", \"So if that advices adequate. I feel It is adequate and appropriate for her. Why isn't it adequate probably for you?\", \"But you would agree your advice to choice as you frame it to me is useful, right? But you're just having trouble applying that to yourself?\", \"Smooth. That's what you need to work on a bit. So you can kind of see the logic of all this, but your feelings don't match.\", \"Alright, so here's what I want you to do. You familiar with the thought record that I introduced you in the first session where you can outline your situation and your feelings and you've explained all this to me, I want you to actually complete one thought records.\", \"I know after having set it all might seem like doubling the work. But I think it's something changes when you write something down. Okay, I have to face it on paper. And also, it's a good tool to remember exactly what you're thinking. And then work through the adaptive response section and their smiles at the bottom of thought record questions you can ask yourself to help you form that adaptive response. And maybe write out a few different ones. But there's plenty of room on the forum. You see it, right,\", \"That's actually the largest grid cell is the one on adaptive responses, that the responses don't have to be short. like yours wasn't short. There's really good they can they can be long and they can So be realistic, like, I'd like to win. It would be good to win. But Alice should have to be successful.\", \"I thinl  the adaptive response kicked out is to the downside of not having success, okay? It doesn't have to be completely positive. Okay, has to be realistic and useful. And, as importantly, you have to believe it. Okay, there's a place on there to note what percentage you believe that you could write that in. Okay, I know we'll look at that from week to week and, you know, as we move closer to your graduation, hopefully it'll bring you some relief for missing anxiety.\", \"that's sounds like a good plan?\", 'Thanks.', \"All right, great. So this one of the things I wanted to talk with you about is I know that you did some assessments over the last couple of days. And so I want to talk with you about that and just talk with you about kind of treatment and how things are going to go. And based on that sounds like the what, from what you were saying in terms of the assessment process that you have an eating disorder, it's called bulimia nervosa, and I'm not sure if you've ever heard of that.\", \"So what I want to do is kind of describe that for you a little bit. So what you talked about was that there are periods of time when you have when you have eating episodes where you eat, like kind of a large amount of food that you feel like that you've lost control and you feel, you know, like overly full me vomit and the This happens fairly regularly. And there are times to when you, you know, you're maybe really overly concerned about your shape or your weight. And that feel familiar to you. Yeah. So and then it sounds like that's been going on for quite some time, at least, you know, two, three, sometimes even upwards of five times a week.\", \"So just want to let you know to about, about that, that it's not unusual. For a person like in college like yourself to be struggling with an eating disorder like this. In fact, we see upwards of 5% of women and call on college campuses who struggle with that and even more upwards of 20%, who have you know, kind of what we would call kind of variants of that in terms of excessive dieting, and some may even like, throw up or use laxatives or excessively exercise, so it's not unusual. One of the things we know about blaming Nervosa is that for a lot of women, it really starts by Excessive dieting. So like going for long periods of time without eating and sounds like that that was something that you endorsed as well that there are times when you kind of diet excessively. Yeah,\", \"One of the things that we know about bulimia nervosa is that when people overly restrict or you know, stop eating a lot or go for, you know, a day and a half and really restrict their calories, that oftentimes that that kind of leads into that kind of binge eating cycle. And we know that that's the case. The other thing that we're aware of is that a lot of individuals who struggle with eating difficulties like this also report a lot of difficulties they have like with managing stress or managing relationships or have a difficult time knowing what they're feeling or managing feelings. Is that something that you've experienced? Okay. Yeah. All right. Well, that's okay. Because in many respects, I think both things go on for individuals that struggle with eating difficulties like that. And so we know that there's a lot of dieting and restriction that goes on but we also know that there are other things that are happening in terms of managing feelings, managing stress, etc. So one of the things that I like to focus on in terms of working with clients and working with individuals like yourself is I take an approach it's called interpersonal psychotherapy and, and what that means, in essence is that I like to approach the eating problem by looking at kind of the kind of social in kind of more interpersonal context, because there's a lot of things that are probably going on, or may have gone on in your life that have been kind of associated with times and you've been more likely to use food or to restrict your calorie intake. And so what I'd like to do is really talk with you over the next, you know, few sessions about, you know, periods of time in your life currently and in the past where you've had, you know, overeating episodes and when you've restricted your calories, when you've You know, lost weight, or when you, you know binge and things like that and really start looking at, you know, patterns perhaps in your relationships and then what we'll do is kind of sum that up at the end of the time that we're together and see if we can kind of come up with a little bit of a game plan and some goals to help you reduce your binge eating. So how's that sound? Okay. And there's really good evidence for the things you know, the things that we're going to be doing, in fact, the more that we work on some of these issues, you'll you'll know pretty quickly that you're gonna start feeling a lot better and, and it'll have a, you know, pretty positive impact on your eating. Okay, great. So this is what I'd like to do is first of all, first of all, let's start with I want you to give me a recent episode, where like just recently within the last couple days where you've had one of those episodes that you talked about where you felt like a lot that you lost control, and that you ended up vomiting or you know, and and it will and kind of get an idea about that. And then what I'd like to do is and we'll go kind of back in time, and then I want you to tell me the first time that you had an episode like that. So and then then what we'll do then over the next couple of sessions is then we'll, we'll start from when it started and kind of like work our way up to the present. And I'll just ask you a lot of questions and we'll, you know, kind of go from there. Right? So why don't you tell me the Tell me like a recent episode, that where you felt like that you'd lost control. You're eating\", \"Okay. Did you been restricting your your food? You know, for the prior to that or you've been dieting prior to that?\", \"I'm meant to tell you to I like to take a lot of notes at least initially so I have a good sense of what's going on. So what else was going on? Okay, so it sounds like Saturday night out with friends. See person that you like that you've just say you dated some?\", \"Okay. All right. I'm sorry. Okay, so you're kind of interested. Yeah. And then you sounds like what you were, then you began to feel more concerned about how you were how you looked at how your outfit felt. Yeah.\", \"Okay. And so that then, then what's then what happened then is that you go back to the apartment foods there. And then you kind of sat down on the couch and you felt like that you'd lost control.\", \"Okay. It's just kind of a typical scenario.\", 'Okay. And then um, so you went home to the apartment.', 'in school, and what are you working on?', 'Yeah. Because I was thinking about the time of the year, so Coming up or any projects coming up, so, anything big on the horizon for you?', 'okay. Okay. Okay.', \"sounds like it. Um, what's your roommates name?\", \"Kathy. Okay. Okay. So then Kathy has a roommate over quite often this last week she was they were there quite a bit boyfriend, her boyfriend. Okay. And then you're trying to study and did you talk with them about that in terms of the noise or that bothering you?\", \"Sounds like you feel like that you've tried to let her know in various ways that you know, you've got something coming up and that you'd like to study and when it's quiet and you'd like to be able to focus but that the sounds like that. They're kind of constant commotion is really distressing to you, right? If you talk with her, like one to one about How that bothers you or that that's a real problem for you. Okay, she know what's hard about doing that, in terms of talking with her.\", 'Okay. All right, that makes sense. Okay.', \"Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Okay, that's helpful.\", \"Middle School, 12 or 13 years old. Um, good. So we'll start from there. Tell me about your. Tell me about your parents.\", \"Okay, so your mom and dad divorced when you were 10. Okay, and so, alright, so let me Okay, that's helpful. And then you say your mom got remarried.\", \"You haven't any siblings?\", \"Okay. All right. And is that a boy or a little sister? What's her name? Brooke. Okay, so mom remarried. What's your stepdad same? Bruce. Bruce. Okay. Okay. All right. So, Mom and Bruce. They have a little girl and her name is Brooke. Okay, how old is Brooke. Okay, six. Oh, she's six. Okay. Okay. All right. Okay.\", 'kind of do you have a sense about what led up to the divorce or what was going on?', 'Okay. Then Then. So then they divorced when you were 10. And so then how soon after, did your mom marry a Bruce?', 'under two years. Okay. How was that for you to have her remarry so quickly?', 'During the, during that period of time, because I know you talked about middle school, but during the period of time when they were having difficulties with their marriage. What was your, you know, your eating like? or How are you managing that during that time in terms of your feelings about the night? Ah.', 'Were you talking to anybody or you know, anybody? reasonable. Did anybody else know what was going on? Or?', 'And she was aware of what was happening.', \"Okay, even at that time, and sounds like that. You're pretty close to you're pretty close to your dad's mom.\", \"Oh, I'm sorry about that. When did she pass away High School. Okay, so alright, so make a note of that okay all right so yeah definitely make sure that we talk a little bit about that okay so at 10 mom and dad divorce less than two years your Mamrie Mary's Mary's Bruce so then what happened what happened to you after the divorce Did you were you with your dad with with you\", \"okay so then you alright so then Bruce your mom and Bruce in the you because I know you're seeing more time with her moved to what like a different different town different\", 'Okay. All right. So prior to moving to a new school, were you in a public school or private school', 'switch or private school? Okay. Okay. All right. Okay. How was that transition for you going from public school to private school?', 'Okay. And so then that would have been in around the time when you were 1213 when you made that move. Okay, so then, sounds like to that that was the time when you first were aware of struggling with your eating.', 'Oh, that you felt when you say pressure from her In what way? Were she pressuring you?', 'Okay. Like what say that you would fit in more or okay. Okay, okay doing', \"And it sounds like what you were saying was that we'll ask you how you felt. And you said you You said you weren't excited. You weren't excited. Like I wasn't excited, but so doesn't mean so did that mean that you weren't sounds like if you weren't happy?\", 'Okay. And then what when you would do that what would be the risk', \"Okay. Well, so many ways, like, one might be putting words your mouth, but what like, kind of get over it or like deal with it or, okay. So and so then you were feeling pressure from her sounds like also to that you weren't really feeling like that they were really that maybe there wasn't as much concern about your feelings about where you were. Was there anything specifically that your mom would say to you about that in terms of like, kind of the Get over it? You know that?\", \"No, you're in terms of the school.\", \"Okay. All right. So, that kind of pressure. Yeah. And then you said that you didn't really like Bruce, what kind of person was a man? What was making you not like him so well?\", \"Oh, so that maybe that there was something going on between Bruce and your mom prior to the divorce? Yeah. Sorry to hear that must have been really hard. Yeah. And were you keeping in touch with your dad during that time? Yeah. Okay. Like, were you? I mean, how what was the arrangement where you're spending time with him sometimes and spending time with your mom?\", \"Okay. So then, given the fact that in case you weren't happy in school, you said that it was more kind of an uppity school, private school. Kids Was it a mixed school or was it like an all girls school? Yeah, mix school and that kind of clicky sounds like and then your mom really sounds like she really was pressuring you really wanted to try to pressure you so that you fit in a little bit better. So when in this process Did you find yourself like like turning to food or being excessively concerned about your weight or starting to diet binge things like\", 'Okay. And do you recall the first time that you then vomited or use vomiting as a way to kind of like manage the overeating?', \"So she was really critical of how you looked. Okay, okay, so then what was that? What did that do? Let me take a step back. So it sounds like that. You've always been a little closer to your dad. So then what was the divorce and the move and some of that transition? What effect did that have on your relationship with your mom?\", \"Okay. Okay. All right. So the two of you don't get along as well. Okay. Did it was it getting? Was it kind of the same during that time? Or was it getting worse?\", \"Okay. All right. And then she was then coming back more harshly and more critically. Okay. All right. Okay. Well, it's not unusual. I mean, a couple things, certainly not unusual for, you know, girls at that age, you know, in terms of like, kind of the social influence or kind of the social contagion of, you know, with eating and diet, you know, binge eating and dieting and vomiting. So it sounds like that, that was kind of, in some respects part of that culture. But it also sounds like that there, you know, in terms of the external pressure that you were getting from your mom to look a particular way. It almost sounded like that, that she was saying that you were like, What? You were too heavy for a particular outfit. And so then, I'm sure that that Do you remember how that was feeling to you at that time when she would say things like that?\", 'All right cut of Trump. Did you talk to anybody about that? Did you talk with your dad about that? Or?', \"Okay. So you kept a lot of those feelings to yourself. Okay. All right. Okay, well, that's that's, that's helpful. Let's kind of let's kind of hang on to that, because we've got a couple things because obviously, I think the the divorce the move the transition from middle school to high school. Also sounds though that also during that time that you're obviously you didn't have a very good relationship with Bruce to begin with. And that your relationship with your mom was kind of deteriorating. Yeah. And then I know you said your grandmother passed away when you were in, in high school, but during that time, like, you know, eighth or ninth grade, did you have more contact with her? Were you able to, like\", 'okay, okay. Okay, um,', \"Okay, so then, right? So not only did Where's your relationship with your mom kind of deteriorating, then all of a sudden, she's pregnant, she delivers. You have a baby sister. They're working. And now not only are you kind of feeling distressed about your relationship with her, but now you're also feeling the pressure to take care of a baby sister. Okay. Okay, and so, during that time, you're feeling what?\", 'okay. emotional weight on your shoulders. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then and then what was your eat so then that would have been like, you know, the years like 14 maybe to 16 when you were more active. involved with that. What was your eating? Like during that time?', 'So were you binge eating more during that time then?', \"Okay. All right, such as throwing up, so vomiting. Okay, so then that, that kind of began to that started during that particular time. Okay. All right. That's, yeah. Okay. That's really helpful to get that.\", 'Okay, um, did anybody get anybody like emerges like, like a best friend or a really good friend during that time or?', \"Okay, and what's her name?\", 'Julia. Okay. So do you enjoy? Did you enjoy and still kind of maintain contact during the time? Yeah. Yeah. Did Julia know what was going on with you? Are you Did you ever talk with her about kind of like the stress you were under?', \"So if she was one person that you could kind of confide in a little bit. Did she know about your the struggles you're having with your ex With your binge eating no likes.\", \"All right. Okay, that's helpful. So, so Julia was and then kind of a source of support for you during that time. And also sounds like your grandmother was but then you'd also mentioned early on that your grandmother died in high school. Okay, and so that when did she pass away? Okay, when you were 16 Okay. What was that like for you when she died? Yes.\", \"I'm sorry about that.\", 'And so did you, were you able to eventually go? Okay. All right.', \"Okay. All right. So during that time when you were arguing, you notice more, okay. All right. Okay. All right. So, okay, that's helpful.\", 'Oh, okay, so alright, so then', \"Okay, so in the middle of your senior year, then your mom and Bruce get divorced. Okay. All right, so 17 mom and first divorce. Okay, what was that time like for you? Because then obviously then Brooke is then she's about two years old, right? No, no, no, she before. Okay, she's four years old. Okay. Okay. So what was going on?\", 'right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so then what did that do to your How did that impact your relationship with your mom after you know in around the divorce?', 'Okay. All right.', \"Okay, so it's almost as though that No, she didn't have anybody and she was you felt like that. She was kind of like trying to reach out to you, like Mike almost like too little too late or, okay. So then, you know continued sounds like continued kind of like anger and frustration with her. And then did did you notice any changes in your eating during that time?\", 'About the same ?', 'what was going on ?', \"They might be starting to notice that you're under the influence of the Percocet?\", 'Could before I remember when we talked, it seemed like you felt safe in that No one was gonna find you out.', 'So in terms of concentrating, focusing?', 'And this is tough for you. The Percocet makes you feel normal. I would talk about this before. Yeah, it used to give you high, but not anymore.', 'But it makes you feel normal.', \"And we've talked about the detox options.\", \"it's not something that you want. So really, what's changed to make things more difficult is that you're worried that your coworkers are on to you. Right. And it's your performance in terms of focusing on on your accounting work has been compromised as well.\", 'is that right ?', \"And you're afraid that's going to be noticed as well?\", \"Alright. Let's talk about I want to do some scaling work. I want to talk about the importance of this change to you know, cuz we've been talking about this change for a while\", \"Yeah. Let's talk about, let's just talk about the importance of it though. So just focus on that one narrow piece. Okay, we're just we're just talking about how important it is. So on a scale of one to 10, with one being not important at all, and 10 being extremely important. How important is it to you that you that you can make this change? Can you make this change?\", \"Well, so it's important that you keep your job and that importance, in a sense now appears to be tied to the importance of not using Percocet. They've been tied together a little bit, right.\", 'So if you if you if you had to pick a number one to 10, or 10 is extremely important. How important is it to you to make the change?', '7 so fairly important.', 'You have to keep it up?', \"So let's talk about another construct. That's important.\", 'I want to talk about confidence. So using that same scale, how confident are you that you can beat the Percocet?', 'About about six months now.', 'So it was in the one to 10 scale. What do you think you would be?', \"So very low confidence, nope really no confidence. You have no confidence. You have no confidence that you can change and it's very important to you that you do change. So this is a real bind the trend.\", \"You mentioned that one of the reasons your confidence is low is because you tried over the last six months and working with me and you've not been successful at stopping the Percocet use.\", \"So it's easy to see where the low confidence rating comes in. Based on your experiences the last six months. How about other times when you've been able to make a tough change? If you look through your, your past and different experiences, has there been any other occasions where you have been successful, beating something like this and making a tough change?\", 'So that was those tough that was. Would you say that you felt addicted to gambling?', 'And it was painful to stop. Are you happy that you did stop?', 'So when you were in the middle of that addiction of gambling, right, how likely to seem that you would be able to stop back then?', \"So there's some parallels here between what happened with the gambling and with what's happening now the Percocet.\", 'So you would say you were successful at beating that addiction?', 'Definitely success, so what happened?', \"So the mechanism is different. Like for the gambling, you'd have to drive to the casino to drive Delaware Park.\", \"You'd have to have money\", 'Whereas the the percocets so easy. Yeah that you get them for my friends.', \"And it's a lot easier to consume and Percocet than to get in your car and make the time and so the mechanism is different.\", \"But wonder if there's any similarities with this? Well, with the success and the potential success, meaning you you thought that you could never stop gambling, you think that you could never get through detox?\", 'You husband was supportive?', \"So as you reflect on your confidence, and this is not something you necessarily need to do right now. It's probably important to consider that you were successful before in the past. All the circumstances were different.\", 'But you gained too high from that gambling.', 'that was it was addictive?', 'and and you beat it and it and it was hard it was challenging but you also have a supportive husband. Would you have your support your husband if you tried to stop Percocet?', \"Well, since this since stopping is important to you, but your confidence is low. But this might be a good area to kind of process which is, you know, you do have the supports in place, and you have successfully defeated addiction before. So it's something to consider, as you weigh, you know, I know that detox is something you've expressed really clearly that you're not a big fan of and I can appreciate your reasons. At the same time, get support, you don't lose your job. So, let's do this. Let's, between now and when I see you next, maybe reflect on some of the strengths and supports and the past successes you've had.\", \"And see if we can accurately factor those into this equation. Right as you're processing through and and considering a very tough decision. So it makes sense?\", \"So we'll pick up next week there. And I really appreciate you coming in today.\", 'Thanks, you', 'doing good.', \"I'm going to ask you some questions and give you some problems to solve. Please try to answer them as best as you can. Okay. What year is this?\", 'Okay. What season of the year is this?', 'beach season ?', 'What is the date today?', 'what day of the week is this?', 'What month is this?', 'Can you tell me what country we are in', 'What County are we in?', 'What city are we in ?', 'What is the name or the address of this building?', 'What floor of the building we at?', \"I am going to name three objects. After I've said them, I want you to repeat them back to me.\", 'Apple, Table, Penny', \"remember what they are, Because I'm going to ask you to name them again in a few minutes.\", \"Now I'm going to give you a word and ask you to spell it forward and backward. The word is world. First, Can you spell it forward?\", 'Now, can you spell it backward', 'What were the three objects I asked you to remember?', 'Okay. What is this called?', 'What is this called?', 'I would like you to repeat a phrase after me. The phrases is no ifs, ands, or buts.', \"I would like you to read the words on this page. I'm going to hold up. Then do what it says.\", 'Okay. Are you right handed or left handed.', 'right handed ?', 'I want you to take this paper in your right hand. Fold the paper once with both hands, and then put the paper down in your lap.', 'Okay, thank you. All right, if you could pick up the notebook with a piece of paper. I would like you to write any complete sentence on a piece of paper for me, me.', 'Huh hmm', \"Can i see the sentence? Okay. Here's the drawing. Please copy the drawing on that same piece of paper.\", 'You got it ?', 'Thank you Ayesha. I appreciate you participating in that assessment.', 'No. What would you call it?', \"so your husband believes you're having some trouble with anger.\", \"I see you have a, you feel like you have a relational style that doesn't match what he he wants, like you're, you're yelling and he's not liking that\", 'Can you tell me about the the yelling?', \"So you don't feel like you have a problem with yelling or anger or anything?\", \"the way you Guess the way I am? has been causing you vague. It's been causing some, some trouble with your husband. Any other trouble?\", \"Alright, so it's caused you some difficulties that way.\", \"Sure, really here today because he's asked you to come\", \"Alright, but Sure. You're really not convinced that you\", 'Yeah?', \"He's convinced you're not.\", 'who would your relationship be a little easier without the yelling?', 'Can you tell me about some of the events that you think lead to the yelling?', \"And then the argument. How do you find the distribution of like, Who's yelling? Or is it mostly you yelling? Are you both yelling?\", 'Do you ever find yourself planning to get into an argument or is it more spontaneous?', 'Just kind of happens when', \"And that's what leads to the\", 'alRight so this has been causing you some Distress with that relation.', 'Do you have any medical conditions?', 'Do you ever use drugs or alcohol?', 'nothing like that? Do you have any other mental health history I should know about like, depression or anxiety?', 'Do want to see a counselor here to work on the anger yelling.', \"Okay. So, if you're okay with it, I'll set you up with an appointment to see a counselor here. And they should see within a couple of days and you can get started.\", 'Thanks, Stephanie.', \"It's good to see you. Yeah.\", \"Silence. Terrific. So what was what specifically? I mean, I know we've talked a lot about that, but what specifically did you say to her, or how did you bring it up\", \"right. Right. Right. Because I think that's really similar No, we kind of talked about that. Because I remember like a few sessions ago, I was kind of wondering whether or not she really got it in terms of what you were feeling because it seems like one of the ways that you've we talked about that before in terms of like, you know, first starting that oftentimes one of the ways that you manage your feelings that you kind of you think you're letting people know what you're you know, feeling but it doesn't really come out. And I know that it's something that you and I had to really like you know, kind of work out but sounds like that. You were able to talk with her in that She heard you. And as I want, as I kind of thought that she was actually really responsive in a very positive way.\", \"It's really nice, I think to you've been able to do that more with me, and I feel like that, that I feel like it's been really helpful. I know, they've been kind of pushing you on that. And that's been hard, but I feel like it's been really nice to feel like it's really been helpful with your relationship with Kathy. So that's fantastic. And also, you know, again, I know that I've keep, you know, like saying this over and over again. But you know, as you've worked on these things, it's been really notable that it's really had a nice positive effect on your eating because it seems like it's really you've really seen a lot of real nice improvements. So awesome. Anything else that you know, so you had a really good conversation with Kathy, anything else go on this week? Yeah, I got to spend some time with Brooke.\", \"okay. So she's still sixers. Did she have a birthday recently?\", \"Oh, that's great. almost seven great. You plans for birthday for her or what are you\", 'Okay? Like anything frozen. Okay, okay, okay. Yes. Okay, that sounds terrific. And so then you spend some time with her. So obviously that was real positive for you. Did you? When you were there? Did you have any opportunity to, you know, visit with your mom? or How did that go? I', \"How does it feel for you in terms of like for her? I know you've talked about not really liking that. She all the sudden, is deciding now that she wants to really be kind of like, you know, the good mother and kind of like be involved in your life. But how is it for her to kind of like want to want to know how things have been going for you. I mean,\", \"So kind of what we had discussed kind of that you've been, you've like, you've been allowing yourself to be more connected with her, but you're still kind of keeping up keeping a little bit of a boundary. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm sure that would be really hard to trust her after everything that's gone on, you know, with, you know, kind of the infidelity issue with your dad, or at least it's just, you know, kind of like the wondering about that. I mean, I think you kind of know that that was probably what was going on, but then, you know, and then moving you how harsh and critical she was issues with Brooke, you know, even I still even remember to, for her to have gotten to the point where she wouldn't even let you like go to your grandmother's funeral or at least you know, kind of, so all those things have been so like, you know, front and center, you know, and so now I feel like that she's made this real dramatic shift and, you know, wanting to start being a mom, that sounds like that. You're really working to try to manage that in, you know, in a better way?\", \"yeah, yeah, but when you do butt heads, what is it how what happens in terms of your eating when you guys kind of like you feel like that there's a little bit of a friction.\", \"Right. So that really, that's a really stressful time?\", \"Well, it makes a lot of sense because again, you know, like, you know, we've really reviewed this quite a bit but You know, historically, that's how it's been, you know that that's really been a real enemy. It really clarifies why we're working on this because it's so clear that when the two of you have like these rough patches, that it really all of a sudden evokes all these like negative feelings. And that's when food like really, you know,\", \"Right. Right. Yeah. So it's really hard to, you know, I can understand it's really hard to let that go. I mean, cuz obviously, there's a lot of lot of feelings that you have about that. Yeah. Yeah. But on the other hand, too, it seems like that, you know, things have been going really well. How have things been going in terms of just in general like school friendships, you know, anything else that's on the horizon?\", \"I won't get too excited about that. But tell me about him telling you about him.\", \"Now what's this? You have to at least give me his name? What's his name?\", \"Alan. Okay. Okay. All right. Well, did you like, I'm not gonna blow this out of proportion. But how? How did that kind of come about?\", \"Yeah. Nice. Nice. That's great. Oh, I'm really happy. That's great. So, a lot of really nice things that are going on. Yeah, that's terrific. Yeah. So then for you to go like from, you know, because, you know, we kind of got going with this thing. It was kind of like, you were full on binge eating, you know, virtually every day, sometimes twice a day, and now it'd be down to, you know, three, like in the space of like, you know, just like seven eight weeks is pretty remarkable. So no, I'm really pleased with how hard you've been working cuz you've really been pushing yourself. And I really appreciate it. I know this stuff with your mom is particularly hard. It's hard for you\", \"And you may not, you know, I mean it's like, you know, another we talked about there's like maybe there are times when you just don't really want to share some of that stuff. You know, and and I think sometimes my experience has been some parents, like, you know, the goal is not to make her feel bad. If you would want to share it, you'd want to share it knowing that she would hold on to that and keep it and really connect with you around it and want to be helpful rather than like, like, Oh, yeah, you were so mean to me now have an eating disorder, you know, because then that that feels, you know, that doesn't feel quite right. And know that that's, you know, I know that you have a lot of hard feelings, but I don't really feel like that. That's how you'd want that to go, you know? Yeah. And I know we've talked about it a lot, but how are things going with your dad? Yeah,\", \"So nice. They'll be really nice for you to spend time with them. That's great. That's really great. Yeah. So let's talk some more about this thing with your mom, because I feel like that. I mean, I know it's tough, but I guess I've been thinking about this a lot, especially after last session that that given the fact that, you know, you and Brooke are so close, and it does feel like that your mom is, at least she seems like she's making she's trying to make an attempt to connect with you. Whether or not, you know, at what point would you feel like that you? Well, what would you need from her in order to feel like that you could kind of like, maybe not let down the walls, but kind of soften those a little bit. I mean, is there something is there something that like, if you could ask They're like, okay, mom, if you did this, then I would do this. Not that you would do that. But just wondering if like, what would you? ideally what would you like to see in order to feel like that you could connect with her more.\", \"Yeah, I know. We talked about this, but have you gotten to the point yet where you felt like that you could? Like, even let her know that. That that puts a lot of pressure on you or that that comment that she makes kind of hurt your feelings because I know that in the moment you feel it. But what would it be like for you if you were to just like, yeah, say like, you know, I know that you're I know that you mean Well, I mean, maybe she doesn't, but maybe it's sometimes important to approach it that way, but it really hurts my feelings or, you know, I feel like that that really puts a lot of pressure on me to look a particular way. And, you know,\", \"right, because I know that you did that. You've done that with your roommate. I know there's been other times when people have done that. So I know that that's been kind of part of the bigger issue is just knowing what it is you're feeling and also being able to kind of give voice to that and you know, thinking about that relationship with your mom because it does seem like that every once in a while she kind of like jabs here, she'll send something out and and, and the way that you take it in is more like harsh, critical. You know her and, and I just don't know like color. It's kinda like with Kathy. When you Talk with her how it's like, it was like, it was like, Oh, of course, like, you know, uh, you know, I'll try to be more sensitive and I'm not really sure. You know whether or not your mom would be.\", \"yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, I think there are times when I wonder if like, maybe if there's a time when you say something, like, I know there have been times when you kind of snap back at her, you know, or you'll kind of like, you know, barber or kind of jabber a little bit. What if, you know, again, you What have you thought about like, because it sounds like that you're really aware when you do that? Because you know that when she says something, you have a tendency to jet back. You could just say, you know, You know, I realized I was I, that was a that was a jab at you. And I'm really sorry, I aware that that sometimes I kind of get really critical with you and I that doesn't I don't feel very good about that. Now I wonder how she would you know if, if that would, what that would do, maybe, maybe it wouldn't do anything or may make you feel a little bit too vulnerable, but you think about it, I mean, and you kind of Mull that over in your mind about what that might be like, because my experience has been that sometimes. You know, I hate the phrase, be a bigger person, because then you know, I didn't want that to come across that way. But sometimes in order to change relationships, somebody has to be willing to kind of like, kind of be willing to do something just a little different. And since it seems like you have a growing awareness of, you know, the interactions that you have with her I wonder if that might be worthwhile. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. mulling over and think about it and, and we'll keep talking about it. But yeah, sounds like it was a really terrific week and been working really hard it really pays off because again, the more you've done that we've seen real positive impact on your eating so nice\", \"so you feel like you're, you're drinking more than usual. How much are you drinking now?\", 'three or four nights a week?', 'And how much are you drinking each time to go?', \"Alright, so do you know how much alcohol you consume in the time period. Do you know how much you're actually drinking?\", 'So do you find that you need to drink more to get the desired effect?', 'Have you made any attempts to cut down on consumption?', \"It's okay. So, I want to talk about the time you spend using alcohol. Are you are you okay with the amount of time you mentioned that you're using for longer periods? But are you okay with? Or is that something that's distressing you?\", 'Do you find that you have a craving for alcohol?', \"So you're thinking about it, but you also like feeling the craving.\", \"You mentioned work, you're having trouble with responsibilities at work or any other area?\", 'Have you had any social problems due to the alcohol?', 'All right. So no social problems.', \"You haven't missed any important activities. How about engaging in activities that are physically dangerous?\", 'Do you have any medical or mental health history?', 'some issue now? Has any medical problem or mental health problem become worse because of alcohol?', 'So you mentioned the alcohol use. Has there been any drug use?', \"So it's just alcohol?\", 'All right. When you stopped drinking, do you have any physical symptoms or anxiety any symptoms of withdrawal?', \"Okay, so that's not a problem. All right. Jackie, open to Receiving counseling services or agency?\", \"I think okay, okay. All right. I'm gonna get you scheduled in to see a counselor. I want to thank you for telling me about what's going on for answering my questions. It's been helpful.\", \"Yeah. Well, and this is really the one of the key parts of what may be causing this distress. We talked about this insecurity. You're on this I'm sure. And so you know, one question may be, did you make a efficient or less efficient decision with this particular family but the larger question is, you as a person can you can you do this, this job and if you do it and make money Like, what would you do then? Could you go through this again?\", \"And it could be you certainly in a job where, like, most jobs where mistakes have consequences. You also do a lot of good for a lot of people. So by you not being in the field. They're not getting the benefit of the skills you have.\", \"So, so mostly This was good until recently. Well, alright, let's look at this from another point of view. You really seem like, you can empathize with these families. You really, to me, it seems like you really know what they're feeling.\", \"and appreciating their perspective. Take a moment and try to walk in their shoes. If a professional like yourself came to you and your family situation and maybe you're engaged in the activities where it was warranted that your family we've broken up temporarily. What would you want? How would you want them to process that? Like you said, thinking about the caseworker from the point of view of the family? How would you want them to feel that? Would you want them to process that decision?\", \"So from the family's point of view, if you're in that situation, you can appreciate what the caseworker has to do. Well, you'd like to have some compassion for you. Okay, that seems reasonable. Yeah. So now flip back into the role you're in. You made the decision you had to make although you're second guessing it That's separate. Do you have compassion for them?\", \"I'm good. How are you?\", \"I saw you last time a week ago. And I know you've had some concerns with employment working on employment. The first before we get into that I wanted to check in and see how you're doing emotionally. I know from last week, on a scale of one to 10 you said you were suffering from depression at about seven. Yeah. How is it today?\", \"So you're having some concerns about full time work and that level of energy, you'd have to exert that commitment. Alright, so we'll be okay today, if we kind of structured, what we're going to do sure for for this session. So, if it's okay with you, I'd like to talk about that. Okay. All right and and get some more details about kind of what's going on this week and your feelings surrounding that. And we touched on this a little bit in the last session. But I'd like to talk about kind of your core beliefs, your central beliefs that might be contributing some of these feelings of depression. Yeah. And then, for the last part, we'll work on like we did before, interventions to try to help you with with what's going on at work and with your depressed mood. And we can make changes to this as needed. I just want to start with an outline that we can, we can have going in okay. So make sense. Okay. Anything you want to add or take away from that?\", \"Okay. So, tell me a little bit more about what's going on with the work.\", 'So, the latter part of the day is more of a struggle for you.', 'So getting up in the morning and getting to work on time. You do okay with that.', \"So the work program you're in now, you work in the morning?\", 'What hours are you there?', \"And there's some work you have to do in the afternoon.\", \"Thinking about it's exhausting. Can you tell me what type of thoughts you're having?\", \"I don't think I can just there's just too many hours.\"]\n",

[sep] p: yeah. i mean, he's worried that i'm depressed, but i am not. [sep] t: yeah, he had mentioned that you had some concerns about some things going on in a neighborhood and you call the police a few times. [sep] p: he told you that? [sep] t: they told me about that. [sep] p: well, yeah, i mean, i had called i have called the police a few times because there's something going on in my neighborhood. and it's, yeah, makes me seem like i'm depressed but i'm not i just i'm concerned. about what's going on. [sep] t: sure you're not depressed, you're more concerned. so what's going on? we live it's misleading to these feelings. [sep] p: um, well, it's actually very scary, huh. there i know about. the government has been kidnapping girls in this area and taking them away for sex trafficking and prostitution. [sep] t: to boot the government is apprehending people in the area relive i know they are, you know they are [sep] p: yes. [sep] t: and did you see things that's specifically led you to believe this? [sep] p: yeah, yes. so, there specifically were two girls that lived down the street. and i saw a man come come down the street and the girls were taken. and that's when i initially called the police. but i found that they're in on it to the [sep] t: police are in on it too. [sep] p: yes. [sep] p: they tried to tell me that the girls were they're safe and where they're at, but i know they're not. [sep] t: so then they investigated what you saw. and they came back and told you that [sep] p: they pretended to, [sep] t: they pretended to investigate. yeah. and they came back and told you everything was okay. but you're not. [sep] p: i know. i mean, i know it's a lie. because, you know, i saw that i haven't seen a girl since like, i saw the girls on the street. the man came, the girls went out there. [sep] p: and [sep] p: they told me everything's fine. but i know there's a lie and i won't go back to the police again, because i know that they're now on it. [sep] t: they're in on the, what the government's been doing. so what do you think of your father's concerns with, he's concerned that you're, that you're down there depressed, and that your thinking hasn't been been clear? when you think about his concerns? [sep] p: i mean i know he's, he's worried about me. but, you know, it's interesting to understand the severity of the situation. and, you know, it's hard. it's hard to sleep. i'm thinking about these poor girls. and, you know, it's the government, like, the government has cameras everywhere, and they can watch what i'm doing it all times. and it's, you know, it's exhausting. so i can see how he would think i'm depressed. because, you know, i'm bored. i, you know, i'm not sleeping well, and i'm not eating because what if they poisoned my food? you know, they're poisoning water all the time. so, you know, it is scary and it is affecting anybody. it's not depression. [sep] t: you're not you're not depressed. [sep] p: no [sep] p: i'm sad for those girls. and i'm scared for, for me and like what's going on? but, you know, i want to make sure that this doesn't happen again because you know, i can't let it happen. we can't let this continue. so that's, that's what's taking up my time right now. [sep] t: and how long has this been going on? [sep] p: for a few months, a few months [sep] t: is that when you first saw what you what you believe to be in kidnapping [sep] p: when i saw the kidnapping? yes [sep] t: those few months ago? [sep] t: were there any beliefs like this before? two months? [sep] p: i mean, yes. i've always been aware that the government you know, is probably up just to things that they probably shouldn't be and that they have access and abilities beyond, you know, the normal person. but after i saw the kidnapping, i had proof and so it's it's gotten worse because i feel like they know that i know. [sep] t: so you felt this way for a while, but seeing what you saw two months ago that made you more short? [sep] p: yes. because now i have proof [sep] t: because i have proof have you ever been treated for depression in the past? [sep] p: yes. my dad has taken me before when he was worried about me. but i, you know, it's never really been depression. it's always been something else. like, i'm fine. i just, i'm aware of what's going on around me. and i don't think my dad understands that i don't think the places he takes me understands that. so [sep] p: what have the people at the places where he has taken, you know, what have they said about your condition? [sep] p: um, you know, they, they try to say the same thing that you know, i'm depressed or whatever, but, you know, i know i know the truth and sometimes i just have to play along. [sep] t: just play along with it. [sep] p: yeah, because, you know, this is what the government wants, they want me to look crazy. so there's nothing i can do about it. [sep] t: you think they want to discredit you? [sep] p: because if i if, you know, it's kind of like smearing my good name. they see me in and out of different agencies and appearing crazy. you know, obviously a lot of people don't believe the story they choose not to believe where they get paid off. and they write what they write on my file but it's not true. i'm just know what's going on. [sep] t: because you know what's going on. that's what's led to all these occurrences. this is this has led to the symptoms. [sep] p: yeah, like lately yeah. like, you know, i haven't been asleep, you know, and, you know, i feel guilty about what's going on. right. mean that i know and that, you know, i feel it's hard for me to help them, like with, you know, cameras everywhere and i came to the grocery store without being watched. and i know they're watching me so you know, i i do everything else was too, you know like i go to work i do the chores, because i have to make sure they see me going to work chores. [sep] t: so you see you kind of play along. [sep] p: yeah. [sep] t: all right. so do you ever have any thoughts related to death or dying or anything like that? [sep] p: no. [sep] p: no, like i'm worried. no. [sep] t: you worried about what? [sep] p: i mean. i'm worried about the government, you know, destroying my life, you know, but i don't want to die and i don't think they're going to kill me. i think that'd be too easy. and it would just be more proof.\n",

      "🔹 Input: t: jasmine how you doing today? [sep] p: okay, [sep] t: okay. what's been going on? [sep] p: i just been dealing with so much anger that i'm having difficulty controlling in my everyday life a [sep] t: lot of anger. yeah. can you give me some examples? [sep] p: like for instance, [sep] p: i go to the dry cleaner, the pickup my fiance's uniforms, and the lady had them like ball bag together and i mean, i could have easily just asked her because she separate them. but i begin to yell caused a big commotion because i was so frustrated and angry. she actually was about to call the police escort me out. and i don't think i'm even allowed to go back to the driveway anymore. [sep] t: so quite a bit of anger. [sep] p: yeah. my neighbor's dog was barking late at night. i know my neighbors when they can't control that. but i get into a huge fight with my neighbors argument. we're not speaking at the moment and it's just raw uncomfortable. but, i mean, i feel bad now that it's over with none. i thought about it. and i just don't know why i was so upset that the dog was work. [sep] t: right. so from your perspective, it doesn't seem to make sense why he got so angry. [sep] p: no, i just it's been going on for some time. now. i just get little things just i just explode. [sep] p: so i don't know why [sep] t: did anything change around the time that i started? [sep] p: nothing that i can really think of just when i'm overwhelmed. i have so much to do. i kind of just break down and just become extremely upset with everything around me. [sep] t: alright, so you're getting upset you have some anger [sep] t: any other time that you're feeling angry [sep] p: when i go to the go workout at the kickboxing class i'm like the go all out like i use that as like a release. i'm punching the bags of shame before i actually had hurt my wrist last week. i just go all out in there and my trainer kind of notices like are you okay? and i'm like it's just relief kind of gained all the anger i had been out so. [sep] t: alright, so that experience for you. you feel like you're releasing more energy than maybe the other people in the game can wait [sep] p: you are way more i'm like loud, i'm sweating bullets. i'm just going all out like extremely angry. [sep] t: alright, so the [sep] t: in recent memory, your anger has increased, but it's still not really clear what's going on. that's causing the anger. [sep] p: not really i just feel like frustrated does have so much going on at the moment. so it's kind of like just feel overwhelmed, i guess not take it out. [sep] t: you feel busy, like in your daily life, like a lot of responsibilities? [sep] p: yes, a whole lot [sep] t: and what kind of things you're doing. [sep] p: mainly, mainly take care of home does not mean i don't i don't work or anything. so i kind of just take care of home and, you know, with the kids and everything, it's just a lot. so [sep] t: see a lot of responsibilities in the home. [sep] p: guess all of the responsibilities all [sep] p: it feels like all of them? yeah. [sep] t: what type things are you doing? [sep] p: i'm cooking, i'm cleaning. [sep] p: now i have to earn all of my husband's uniforms and get everything ready for him. i had to make sure i cook breakfast i had to make sure i pick lunch. i had to make sure i have dinner ready income i had to help the kids with their homework. i just have so much going on like it's constant, catering, catering, catering, cater and it feels like i just really don't get a break or any other help is just made every day. [sep] t: you're doing everything and has always been this way. [sep] p: not always but it seems it's been like this for some time. [sep] t: okay. where you're really just doing everything in the home. [sep] p: everything. [sep] t: i want to ask you [sep] t: can i ask you or mention a few words? right? i would like you to, if you're okay with this exercise, tell me the first thing that comes to mind like and you can buy say a word, you can offer several responses. but try not to invest a lot of thought into the response more just what occurs to you. oh, but does that make sense? [sep] p: yeah. [sep] t: all right. so the first word is [sep] p: structure, responsibility. [sep] p: repetition, [sep] t: repetition. [sep] t: all right. let me give you another word, relationship. [sep] p: conflict, power struggle. [sep] p: disagreements. [sep] t: let me offer you another word [sep] t: work. [sep] p: independence, [sep] p: freedom [sep] p: able to express creativity. [sep] t: good, alright. how about another word here? power [sep] p: of constant struggle [sep] p: extremely controlling. [sep] t: so do you see any [sep] t: themes and in the words that you provided back [sep] p: seems like everything is like really controlled and [sep] p: structured, [sep] t: controlled and structured?\n",
      "🔸 Target: what's the source of that controlling structure? is there a source of it?\n",
      "\n",
      "🔹 Input: t: should i do it today? [sep] p: okay. [sep] t: you did okay. i understand you haven't been feeling too great lately. [sep] p: i mean, yeah. [sep] p: i i've never like feeling awesome. really. but lately i've come to my awareness. but you know, i might be wrong. [sep] t: something might be wrong in what way maybe? [sep] p: well you know it's nothing new but i have a lot of trouble sleeping yeah, i usually go to bed early, you know, i might go a little bit late. but then i wake up always really early, like, i'll set my alarm for like eight but i always wake up at like, five or something and then i can't get back to sleep. [sep] t: you're waking up earlier than you want to. [sep] p: yes, i can't get back to sleep, no matter how hard i try. and i'm tired still during the day. i don't have a lot of energy, but it doesn't matter. it just it's hard for me to go to sleep. and it's it's been like that for a really long time. probably since high school. but, you know, lately i'm just i realized, you know, some days are better than others, but so having a couple weeks here that really like made me feel like shouldn't talk to someone well, my brother got married and i'm very close to him. and i was really looking forward to the wedding. and then when i when i just i mean, i didn't not enjoy it, but i just didn't have as much fun as i thought i would. and i know it's just because of my mood like that i'm always a little gloomy. you know, my sister, my brother says, i'm like, you're so like, but i was really looking like i, you know, i step out of my comfort zone. i like to try new things. and i was really looking forward to this when i used to love i love weddings, you know, and it's not that i don't love them now, but i thought i would enjoy it more than i did. and that kind of like, freaked me out. [sep] t: so so your mood, your mood, didn't elevate like, maybe you hoped it would. [sep] p: yeah, i mean, i would have thought that i mean, i've been looking forward to this reading for a year and a half i, you know, i helped, you know, my now sister planet, and it just wasn't as fun as i wanted it to be. [sep] p: or as i thought it would be, you know, [sep] t: and realizing, this is what brought in today. [sep] p: yeah, and like right afterwards, like last week. you know, it was i've more worst days than better days like i woke up early the next morning even though i had been up late at the wedding. and just sat there and thought about it and was really just upset by the whole thing upset that i couldn't be more happy. or, you know, my brother and for me really not even for my brother just because i was happy for him. just didn't feel excited like everyone else. everyone else around me was having such a good time and i was just [sep] t: more down. [sep] p: yeah, like i was happier than i would be if i was sitting at home by myself, but i wasn't. i wasn't like everyone else. [sep] t: all right, so you you mentioned that this is a go to one from high school. yeah, sure. how long would that be? [sep] p: oh, i mean, i graduated in 2010. so eight years. [sep] t: so about eight years and even even feeling down has the sleeping problem for that one. [sep] p: yeah, i mean, i a little bit when i was in high school, i thought it was, you know, i was just a quirk or something about staying up late and like ours in high school, but it never like i got better even when i you know started working out of school and stuff i mice sleep schedule never came to that normal eight hours a night like you're supposed to i don't know whatever it is, but it just never. yeah. so sleeps always been an issue and i just like i said my brothers called me or for years just because [sep] t: you mentioned the word gloomy. [sep] p: yeah. [sep] t: and the low energies been a problem for that long as well. [sep] p: yeah. [sep] t: and you've been waking up earlier than you want. [sep] p: yeah. [sep] t: how about you? do you mentioned the depressed mood? you feel down? is that worse than a particular time of the day? [sep] p: yeah, i mean, it's worse than that in the morning. especially when i'm just like sitting there with my thoughts. when i can't get back to sleep. it will be that and then you know we time to get ready for the day and i'll be angry and mad that it's, you know the i can't sleep and then depressed about you know that i'm like this and i'm weird and then i mean as the day goes on i forget about it a little bit and it gets a little bit better in the afternoons and nighttime i really like you know, i enjoy spending time with my family for dinner and stuff like that. so it gets better as the day goes on. but, you know, in the morning it's it's bad because i just spent hours lying there thinking about it. [sep] t: it was the morning mornings the worst. [sep] p: yeah. [sep] t: so i'm gonna ask you some other questions related to this. you mentioned depressed mood. and you mentioned how you reacted to the wedding. how it wasn't what you hoped. have you lost in in other things that might be fun or pleasurable. [sep] p: i haven't really lost an interest in anything like i still, you know, i still seek out fun activities, and i still participate in them. and i mean, they'll make me feel better than not doing them. but it's just, i don't know, it's just i don't. i guess my response to them isn't as high as i see other people enjoying activities, and i don't, but i do enjoy them [sep] t: as much okay. [sep] t: any changes to your appetite or weight? [sep] p: no one stays the same. [sep] t: how about feelings of restlessness or the opposite kind of being slowed down? i know that. [sep] p: no. [sep] t: ever feel a sense of worthlessness? [sep] p: no, [sep] t: like that. how about concentration? how's that been? [sep] p: let's focus on what i need to focus on.\n",
